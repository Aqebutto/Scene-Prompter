The vision depicted in the previous chapter transpired in the third year of Belshazzar, dated 538 BC. The incidents conveyed in this chapter, however, unfolded in the first year of Darius's reign. Given that Belshazzar marked the end of Babylon's reign while Darius heralded the advent of the Medo-Persian era, the interval separating the occurrences of these two chapters is likely less than a single year.
The reference to Seventy Years of Captivity denotes an important period. Regardless of the fact that Daniel held the office of prime minister of the preeminent empire of the time, burdened with an array of duties and responsibilities, he did not permit this to impede his pursuit of higher knowledge, specifically the divine intentions revealed through His prophets. Daniel garnered understanding through texts, notably the writings of Jeremiah, that God intended to effect seventy years of captivity upon His people. This prophecy can be found in Jeremiah 25:12 and 29:10. This knowledge and the ensuing application thereof affirm Jeremiah's early recognition as a prophet inspired by divinity; otherwise, his writings would not have been assembled so promptly, nor replicated so widely. Despite their concurrent existence for a time, Daniel possessed a copy of Jeremiah's works, which he kept during his own exile. Even though he himself was a revered prophet, Daniel demonstrated humility by diligently studying revelations made to his fellow servants of God.
It is essential not to conflate the seventy years of captivity with the subsequent seventy weeks. Dating the captivity period commencing from 606 BC, Daniel discerned that it was nearing its culmination, and that God had already set in motion the actualization of the prophecy through the downfall of the Babylonian kingdom.
Even when God has made a promise, we are not absolved from the duty of imploring Him for the fulfillment of His word. Daniel might have reasoned thus: God has pledged to liberate His people at the close of seventy years, and He will assuredly uphold this promise; there is no need, therefore, for me to immerse myself in the matter. But Daniel did not rationalize in this manner; rather, as the time approached for God's word to materialize, he committed himself to seek the Lord with unreserved devotion.
Such was the intensity of his engagement, he undertook it accompanied by fasting, adorned in sackcloth, and enveloped in ashes! It is probable that this was the year when Daniel faced the ordeal of the lions' den. Recall that the edict ratified by the king prohibited his subjects from presenting any petition to any deity save the king, under penalty of death. Yet, in defiance of the decree, Daniel offered this prayer thrice daily, his windows open toward Jerusalem.
Presented here is the commencement of Daniel's remarkable prayer, a plea manifesting such profound humility and heartfelt contrition that it would leave untouched no soul who reads it. He commences by recognizing the unswerving faithfulness of God, who remains unfalteringly committed in all His dealings with His followers. The Jews' captivity was not borne out of any deficiency on God's part in safeguarding and supporting them, but solely a consequence of their transgressions.
Up to this juncture, Daniel's prayer remains devoted to a profound and sorrow-laden admission of guilt. He ardently justifies God's actions, accepting that the sins of his people have precipitated all their misfortunes, precisely as God had warned them through the prophet Moses. He abstains from any favoritism or self-justification. There is a conspicuous absence of self-righteousness in his supplication. Despite enduring a septuagenarian captivity due to the transgressions of others, and leading a life of devout virtue whilst being blessed and lauded by God, he levels no accusations against anyone, nor does he seek empathy for himself as a casualty of others' wrongdoings. Instead, he aligns himself with the collective guilt, stating, We have sinned, and unto us belongs confusion of face. He concedes that they have neglected to heed the lessons God intended to impart through their tribulations.
The prophet now implores for the honor of the Lord's name, presenting it as a justification for his supplication to be accepted. He alludes to the emancipation of Israel from Egyptian bondage, and the resultant exalted renown that God's name gained from the remarkable works manifested amongst them. Such renown would be forfeited should God abandon them to their fate now. Moses similarly argued when advocating for Israel. (Numbers 14.) This is not to imply that God is swayed by ambition or vanity; rather, when His people display their devotion to His name, when they demonstrate their love by entreating Him to act not for personal gain but for His own glory, to forestall His name from being mocked and blasphemed among the heathen, such sentiments find favor with Him. Consequently, Daniel pleads for the city of Jerusalem, bearing God's name, and His sacred mountain, cherished by Him, imploring Him to deflect His anger for the sake of His mercies. Lastly, his thoughts converge on the holy sanctuary, God's terrestrial abode, as he petitions for the amelioration of its desolation.
Daniel grasped that the seventy years of captivity were nearing their conclusion. His reference to the sanctuary intimates a misunderstanding of the consequential vision granted to him in Daniel 8, leading him to erroneously assume that the 2300 days also came to an end at the same time. This misinterpretation was swiftly rectified when the angel arrived to provide him with further elucidation in response to his prayer.
The outcome of Daniel's entreaty is presented here. He finds himself abruptly interrupted by a celestial emissary. The angel Gabriel, assuming the same human guise as he had previously, the one Daniel had observed in the initial vision, makes contact with him. An essential question now presents itself: Has the vision of Daniel 8 ever been elucidated, and can it ever be comprehended? To what vision does Daniel allude when he employs the phrase, the vision at the beginning? The consensus amongst all is that this must refer to a vision previously recorded, and that in said vision, some mention of Gabriel must be found. Therefore, we must look beyond this ninth chapter, since everything within this chapter prior to Gabriel's appearance is simply an account of Daniel's prayer.
Looking back over previous chapters, we encounter references to only three visions imparted to Daniel. The interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's dream was revealed through a nocturnal vision (Daniel 2: 19), though there is no mention of any angelic involvement. The vision of Daniel 7 was interpreted by one of them that stood by, likely an angel, and there is nothing in that vision which required further clarification.
The vision of Daniel 8 provides some specifics which indicate it as the pertinent vision. Here, Gabriel is introduced by name. Daniel had previously confessed his lack of understanding, indicating that Gabriel had not completed his mission at the conclusion of Daniel 8. There is no place elsewhere in the entirety of the Bible where this instruction continues, if not in Daniel 9. Thus, if the vision of Daniel 8 is not the one under consideration, we are left without any record of Gabriel's full compliance with his given directives or of any subsequent explanation of the vision.
The instruction the angel now imparts to Daniel, as will be observed in the ensuing verses, precisely completes what was absent in Daniel 8. These factors conclusively affirm the connection between Daniel 8 and 9, and this connection will be further fortified through examination of the angel's directives.

The manner in which Gabriel presents himself on this occasion implies that he has arrived to accomplish an unfulfilled task. This can be none other than the previously given directive to make Daniel understand the vision, as noted in Daniel 8. He proclaims, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding. As the responsibility to enlighten Daniel still lay upon him, and as he had elucidated to Daniel in chapter 8 all that he could then absorb, yet Daniel failed to comprehend the vision, Gabriel now arrives to resume his task and complete his mission. As Daniel embarked on his impassioned plea, the decree was issued; Gabriel received orders to visit Daniel and provide the necessary enlightenment.
The reader can estimate the speed with which this celestial messenger was dispatched from the divine court to God's servant by the time it takes to peruse Daniel's prayer until the point when Gabriel appears. Little wonder that Daniel notes the swiftness of his flight, or that Ezekiel likens the movements of these heavenly beings to a flash of lightning (Ezekiel 1: 14).
Understand the matter, Gabriel instructs Daniel. What matter? Surely, it is the matter that Daniel previously failed to comprehend, as indicated in the final verse of Daniel 8. Consider the vision. What vision? Neither the interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's image, nor the vision of Daniel 7, for neither presented any difficulty; rather, it must be the vision of Daniel 8, which left Daniel in a state of bewilderment and lack of comprehension. I am come to show thee, the angel also declares.
Daniel encountered no challenges in understanding what the angel relayed to him about the ram, the he-goat, and the little horn, symbolizing the empires of Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome. Nor was he mistaken about the conclusion of the seventy-year captivity. However, the focus of his supplication was the restoration of the sanctuary, which lay in ruins. It is likely that he had surmised that the end of the seventy-year captivity would coincide with the fulfillment of the angel's previous declaration concerning the cleansing of the sanctuary at the end of the 2300 days. He now required correction. This clarifies why, at this precise moment, shortly following the earlier vision, further instruction was sent to him.
As the seventy years of captivity neared their end, Daniel was operating under a misunderstanding. It was imperative that he no longer be left in the dark concerning the true meaning of the previous vision. I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding, the angel declared. Could there be a more distinct demonstration of the connection between the angel's previous visit and this one than such words, spoken at such a time by such a messenger?
A single phrase in verse 23, For thou art greatly beloved, seems worthy of attention. This declaration, made by the angel to Daniel, was delivered directly from the heavenly courts. It encapsulated the sentiments held there towards Daniel.
Consider the high-ranking celestial beings, the Father, the Son, and the holy angels, holding such esteem for a mortal man on earth as to send an angel with the message that he is greatly beloved. This constitutes one of the loftiest peaks of glory that mortals can scale. Abraham reached another, when he was declared the friend of God, and Enoch another, when it was said of him that he walked with God. Can we strive for such heights? God does not play favorites; but He does regard character. If we were to mirror the virtue and godliness of these eminent men, we could stimulate an equally profound divine affection. We, too, could be greatly beloved, could be friends of God, and could walk with Him. We are called upon to be in our generation what they were in theirs.
A metaphor used concerning the last church signifies the closest union with God: If any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come into him, and will sup with him, and he with Me. Revelation 3: 20. To dine with the Lord symbolizes an intimacy tantamount to being greatly beloved by Him, walking with Him, or being His friend. Such a position is most desirable! Alas, the vices of our nature sever us from this communion. May we be granted grace to overcome these, that we may enjoy this spiritual unity here, and ultimately partake in His glorious presence at the marriage supper of the Lamb!

These initial words spoken by the angel to Daniel serve as the unveiling of the instruction that he came to impart. The sudden introduction of a temporal element prompts a return to the vision described in Daniel 8. Daniel declares his lack of comprehension of the vision at the conclusion of that chapter. However, certain portions of the vision had been distinctly elucidated. Consequently, it could not have been these elements that baffled Daniel. Therefore, one must question which aspect of the vision remained elusive, which part went unexplained.
In this vision, four key elements emerge: the ram, the he-goat, the little horn, and the span of 2300 days. The symbols of the ram, the he-goat, and the little horn were explicated, yet no explanation was offered regarding the temporal period. Hence, this must have been the elusive point. The rest of the vision held no value while the significance of the 2300-day period remained shrouded in ambiguity.
As the esteemed Dr. Hales remarked in his commentary on the seventy weeks, This chronological prophecy... was evidently designed to explain the foregoing vision, especially in its chronological part of the 2300 days. [1]
Assuming this perspective to be accurate, one would naturally anticipate the angel to commence with the point previously overlooked: the temporal element. Indeed, this is precisely what transpires. After drawing Daniel's attention emphatically and directly to the prior vision and assuring him that he has now arrived to grant understanding, the angel initiates the discourse at the exact point previously neglected: Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city.
Extracted from the 2300 Days. But how does this phrasing establish a link with the 2300 days, or shed light upon that period? The answer lies in the fact that the language can be intelligently referred to nothing else. The word translated as determined denotes cut off, and the vision in question furnishes no other timeframe from which the seventy weeks could be severed except the 2300 days. Hence, the connection is direct and natural. Seventy weeks are cut off. Cut off from what? The answer is indisputably the 2300 days.
The word determined in this clause is a translation of the Hebrew {HEBREW CHARACTERS IN PRINTED TEXT}, nechtak, rooted in a primitive term defined by Strong as meaning to cut off, (i.e., fig.) to decree determine (the latter by implication). The Authorized Version adopts the more distant definition, rendering it as, seventy weeks are decreed [i.e., allotted] upon thy people. Resorting to the primary and simpler definition, we derive seventy weeks are cut off for thy people.
If these weeks are severed, it must be from a larger whole—in this case, the twenty-three hundred years of prophecy previously discussed. It is noteworthy that Gesenius offers the same definition as Strong: to cut off, . . . to divide, and so to determine, to decree. He then cites Daniel 9:24, and translates the phrase as, are decreed upon thy people. Davidson likewise offers the exact same definition, also referring to Daniel 9:24 as an example.
One might then question why our translators opted for determined when cut off appears to be the more apparent meaning. The answer lies in the probable oversight of the connection between the eighth and ninth chapters. Given that they deemed it improper to render it cut off when there was no apparent source from which the seventy weeks could be cut off, they chose the figurative over the literal meaning. However, as we have observed, both the definition and context mandate the literal meaning, thereby rendering any other interpretation inadmissible.
Thus, seventy weeks, or 490 days of the 2300, were specifically designated for Jerusalem and the Jews. The events to transpire within this period are briefly outlined. The transgression was to reach completion, denoting the Jewish people's culmination of their sinfulness in their rejection and crucifixion of Christ. An end of sins, or sin offerings, [*] was to be reached. This eventuated when the ultimate offering was made on Calvary. Reconciliation for iniquity was to be offered. This was attained through the sacrificial death of the Son of God. Everlasting righteousness was to be introduced, the righteousness that our Lord demonstrated in His sinless life. The vision and prophecy were to be sealed, or validated.
The prophecy is put to the test by the events occurring within the seventy weeks. This determines the application of the entire vision. If the events of this period are fulfilled accurately, the prophecy is divine, and will come to fruition. If these seventy weeks are realized as weeks of years, then the 2300 days, which these form a part of, constitute as many years.



As we embark upon the scholarly examination of the seventy weeks, or 490 days, it becomes crucial to recollect that within the realm of Scriptural prophecy, a day equates to a year. On page 144, we previously presented evidence supporting the adoption of the year-day principle; nonetheless, to cater to the reader's convenience, we now proffer two additional citations as below:
Just as it was elucidated to Daniel in what manner the final disparagement would transpire after the sanctuary is cleansed and the vision actualized; and this after 2300 days from the commencement of the decree, ... as per the prophesied reckoning by translating a day into a year, in alignment with the revelation offered to Ezekiel. [2]
It bears noting that a significant majority of interpreters within the English and American spheres, for many years, have been inclined to interpret the days demarcated in Daniel and in the Apocalypse as symbols or representatives of years. Tracing the genesis of this widespread, almost universally accepted, tradition has proven challenging. [3]
Supporters of the year-day principle include illustrious names such as Augustine, Tichonius, Primasius, Andreas, the Venerable Bede, Ambrosius, Ansbertus, Berengaud, Bruno Astensis, along with preeminent modern expositors. [4] However, the most compelling testament to its validity resides in the fact that the prophecies have been actualized based on this principle - a demonstration of its accuracy beyond contestation. This can be observed in the prophecy of the seventy weeks in its entirety, and throughout the prophetic periods of Daniel 7 and 12, and Revelation 9, 12, and 13.
Consequently, the events of the seventy weeks, computed in this logical fashion, provide a comprehensive key to the entire vision.
To Anoint the Most Holy. The prophecy stipulates the anointing of the most holy. The Hebrew phrase, qodesh qadashim, translated here as most holy, is liberally employed throughout the Levitical texts to denote objects and locations, but is seldom attributed to individuals, save perhaps for an exception in this verse. Although the phrase and its Greek equivalent in the New Testament are used to distinguish the most sacred space within the tabernacle, its usage is far from limited to this context. It is also utilized to categorize various elements connected with the hallowed service of the sanctuary, such as the brazen altar, the table, the candlestick, the incense, the unleavened bread, the sin offering, the trespass offering, every dedicated entity, and the like, but never to individuals associated with that service. (Refer to Exodus 29: 37; 30: 10, 29, 36; Leviticus 6: 17, 29; 7: 1; 27: 28.)
In contrast, when pertaining to anointing for service, the term extends to the tabernacle itself and all its vessels. (Exodus 30: 26-29.) In Daniel 9: 24, a specific instance of anointing is foretold in the prophecy. In line with the aforementioned usage of most holy, there is ample reason to posit that this verse prophesies the anointing of the heavenly tabernacle. The earthly tabernacle was anointed for symbolic service; and thus, in keeping with this pattern, it would befit the heavenly tabernacle to be anointed for the antitypical, or true, service as our High Priest commences His gracious ministry on behalf of sinners.
During our scrutiny of the sanctuary in comments on Daniel 8: 14, we observed that a juncture was reached when the terrestrial sanctuary ceded place to the celestial one, and the priestly duties were transferred from one to the other. Before the commencement of the terrestrial sanctuary's service, the tabernacle and all its sacred vessels were to be anointed. (Exodus 40: 9, 10.) Hence, the final event of the seventy weeks here revealed is indeed the anointing of the heavenly tabernacle for the initiation of its service.

The celestial messenger now unveils to Daniel the occurrence intended to mark the commencement of the seventy weeks. This period was to originate from the proclamation to rebuild and restore Jerusalem. Not only is the event that delineates the initiation of this timeframe provided, but also the events which signal its conclusion. This provision forms a dual criterion for evaluating the interpretation of this prophecy. Further enriching the complexity, the span of seventy weeks is divided into three major sections. One of these is further bifurcated, with the subsequent events indicating the termination of each segment. If we can pinpoint a date that aligns with all these events, we can indisputably assert the accurate interpretation of the prophecy, as no interpretation, other than the correct one, could fulfil such an array of conditions.
For the reader's clarity, it is recommended to consider all the converging elements at once, to better fortify against an erroneous application. We must identify, at the period's inception, a decree to restore and build Jerusalem. A span of seven weeks is assigned to this restoration endeavour. Upon reaching the conclusion of this initial division, seven weeks from the outset, we should encounter a rejuvenated Jerusalem in its physical manifestation, the completion of the construction of the streets and the walls. From this juncture, a segment of sixty-two weeks is designated. Upon the culmination of this division, sixty-nine weeks from the genesis, we are to witness the advent of the Messiah, the Prince, to the world. One final week is then added, rounding off the seventy. Midway through this week, the Messiah is anticipated to be cut off, thereby causing the cessation of sacrifice and oblation. At the conclusion of the period assigned to the Jews as the era during which they were to be God's chosen people, we naturally anticipate the dispersal of God's blessings and works to other peoples.
Inception of the Seventy Weeks. We now seek the initial date that will resonate with all these particulars. The decree concerning Jerusalem was to encompass more than mere construction. It was to include restoration. By this, we ought to infer the reintroduction of all aspects of civil, political, and judicial society. When was such an edict promulgated? At the time these words were conveyed to Daniel, Jerusalem was immersed in total desolation, a state it had endured for numerous years. The prospective restoration must refer to its resurrection from this devastation. Consequently, we inquire, when and how was Jerusalem resurrected following the seventy years of captivity?
There are four instances which could be construed as aligning with the command to restore and rebuild Jerusalem. These are:
Dating from the initial two decrees, the seventy weeks, equivalent to 490 literal years, would terminate significantly short of even the advent of the Christian Era. Furthermore, these decrees predominantly concerned the rejuvenation of the temple and the restoration of the Jewish religious practices, rather than the resurgence of their civic governance and system, all of which are encapsulated within the phrase, To restore and to build Jerusalem.
These two mandates marked the onset of the work, forming the initial steps toward the subsequent achievement. However, they were inherently insufficient to satisfy the stipulations of the prophecy, both in terms of their timing and their nature. Given their inadequacy, they cannot be included in the discourse as the benchmarks from which the seventy weeks commence. The remaining query pertains to the decrees bestowed upon Ezra and Nehemiah respectively.
The salient points for consideration here are as follows: In 457 BC, a decree was conferred upon Ezra by the Persian emperor Artaxerxes Longimanus, allowing him to journey to Jerusalem accompanied by as many of his people who were so inclined. This edict granted him an inexhaustible supply of treasure to embellish the house of God, to secure offerings for its services, and for any other purpose he deemed fit. It vested him with the power to institute laws, appoint magistrates and judges, and enforce penalties up to and including death; in essence, to revive the Jewish civil and ecclesiastical state in accordance with the law of God and the ancient customs of the people. This decree has been preserved by divine inspiration and a comprehensive, accurate transcript of it is provided in Ezra 7. It is recorded not in Hebrew, as is the rest of the book of Ezra, but in the official Chaldaic, or Eastern Aramaic, referring us to the original document that empowered Ezra to restore and build Jerusalem.
Thirteen years subsequent to this, in 444 BC, during the twentieth year of the same king's reign, Nehemiah sought and was granted permission to travel to Jerusalem (Nehemiah 2). Evidence suggests that this permission was solely verbal and was personal to Nehemiah, as no reference was made to others accompanying him. He was granted letters to the governors beyond the river to facilitate his journey to Judea and a requisition to the custodian of the king's forest for timber.
Upon his arrival in Jerusalem, Nehemiah found the rulers, priests, nobles, and people, already immersed in the construction of Jerusalem (Nehemiah 2:16). Clearly, they were operating under the decree given to Ezra thirteen years prior. After reaching Jerusalem, Nehemiah successfully completed his mission in fifty-two days (Nehemiah 6:15).
Which of these mandates, Ezra's or Nehemiah's, should be deemed the decree for the revival of Jerusalem, from which the seventy weeks are to commence? This hardly seems debatable.
Counting from Nehemiah's commission in 444 BC disrupts the chronology entirely; for from that point, the prophesied troublesome times accompanying the construction of the street and wall did not persist for seven weeks or forty-nine years. If we commence from that point, the sixty-nine weeks, or 483 years, which were to usher in the Messiah the Prince would culminate in AD 40. However, Jesus was baptized by John in Jordan, and God's voice from the heavens acknowledged Him as His Son in AD 27, thirteen years prior. By this calculation, the middle of the final or seventieth week, signified by the crucifixion, falls in AD 44. However, the crucifixion occurred in AD 31, thirteen years earlier. Lastly, the seventy weeks, or 490 years beginning from the twentieth year of Artaxerxes, would stretch to AD 47, marked by no significant event to denote their conclusion. Therefore, if we reckon from that year, and Nehemiah's grant as the landmark event, the prophecy appears to have failed. As it stands, it merely demonstrates the fallacy of the theory that commences the seventy weeks from Nehemiah's commission in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes.
It is thereby evident that the decree issued to Ezra in the seventh year of Artaxerxes, 457 BC, is the definitive starting point for the seventy weeks. This constitutes the implementation of the decree in accordance with the prophecy. The prior two decrees were seen as preliminary and prepatory to this one. In fact, Ezra considers them as integral parts of it, viewing the entire series of events as a singular whole. For we find in Ezra 6:14, They builded, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia. It is noteworthy that the decrees of these monarchs are referred to collectively as the commandment [margin, decree, singular number] of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes, indicating their unified interpretation, with the different decrees acting as consecutive steps toward the final achievement. The decree could not be considered to have gone forth as proposed by the prophecy until the last requisite permission was incorporated in the decree, backed by the authority of the empire. This milestone was reached with the grant conferred upon Ezra, and not before. At this point, the decree fully embodied the scope and scale stipulated by the prophecy, and its going forth must be calculated from this point.


Shall these dates fall into place if we initiate our count from Ezra's decree? Let us venture into this exploration. Our point of embarkation is 457 BC. Forty-nine years are assigned to the completion of the city and its wall. In connection to this, Prideaux shares, In the fifteenth year of Darius Nothus concluded the initial seven weeks of the seventy weeks foreseen in Daniel's prophecy. As it were, the restoration of Jerusalem and Judea's church and state reached fruition with the final act of reformation, chronicled in the thirteenth chapter of Nehemiah, from verse twenty-three to the end, precisely forty-nine years subsequent to the commencement by Ezra in the seventh year of Artaxerxes Longimanus. [6] This corresponds to 408 BC.
Thus far, we discern a harmonious timeline. Let us proceed with our application of the prophecy's chronometric scale. Sixty-nine weeks, or 483 years, were anticipated to stretch until the arrival of the Messiah, the Prince. Commencing in 457 BC, they culminate in AD 27. What notable event transpired at this time? [***] The Gospel of Luke imparts, Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon Him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art My beloved Son; in Thee I am well pleased. Luke 3: 21, 22. Subsequently, Jesus emerged preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, and saying, The time is fulfilled. Mark 1: 14, 15. This reference to 'time' must be an allusion to a precise, specific, and foretold epoch; but the sole prophetic period known to conclude at this juncture is the sixty-nine weeks of Daniel's prophecy, the period that was prophesied to extend to Messiah the Prince. The Messiah has now arrived, and from His own mouth, He proclaims the termination of that epoch which was earmarked by His manifestation. [+]
Once again, the concordance is undeniable. Furthermore, the prophecy foretells that the Messiah would confirm the covenant with many for one week - the last of the seventy, or the final seven years of the 490. In the midst of this week, we are informed, He would cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease. These Jewish rites, signifying the death of Christ, could only cease at the Cross. And indeed, they virtually came to an end when the temple veil was rent at Christ's crucifixion, even though the external observance lingered until Jerusalem's destruction in AD 70. Following sixty-two weeks, as per the record, the Messiah was to be cut off. It could be interpreted thus: Following sixty-two weeks, in the middle of the seventieth week, the Messiah shall be cut off, and cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease. As 'midst' here refers to the center, the crucifixion is conclusively positioned at the heart of the seventieth week.
The date of the Crucifixion. At this juncture, it becomes crucial to determine the exact year of the crucifixion. Unquestionably, our Savior attended every Passover during His public ministry, with only four such occasions documented prior to His crucifixion. These are found in the verses: John 2: 13; 5: 1; 6: 4; 13: 1. The last-mentioned Passover witnessed His crucifixion. Employing the facts already verified, let us deduce where this positions the crucifixion. As His ministry commenced in the fall of AD 27, His first Passover would occur the succeeding spring, AD 28; His second, AD 29; His third, AD 30; and His fourth and final one, AD 31. This allows three and a half years for His public ministry, aligning perfectly with the prophecy that He would be cut off in the midst, or the middle, of the seventieth week. Since that week of years began in the fall of AD 27, the midpoint would transpire three and a half years later, in the spring of 31, coinciding with the crucifixion. Dr. Hales cites Eusebius, AD 300, stating: It is chronicled in history that the entire duration of our Savior's teachings and miraculous works was three and a half years, which constitutes the half of a week [of years]. This, John the evangelist represents to those who critically peruse his Gospel. [7]
Regarding the abnormal darkness that pervaded during the crucifixion, Hales offers this insight: From this, it appears that the darkness that 'overshadowed the whole land of Judea' at the time of our Lord's crucifixion was preternatural, 'from the sixth until the ninth hour,' or from noon until three in the afternoon, both in its duration and in its occurrence, about the full moon, when a solar eclipse could not possibly take place. The timing and the phenomenon itself are chronicled in a remarkable and invaluable excerpt from a revered Roman Consul, Aurelius Cassiodorus Senator, around AD 514. 'In the consulate of Tiberius Caesar Aug. V and AElius Sejanus (U.C. 784, AD 31), our Lord Jesus Christ suffered, on the 8th of the Calends of April (25th of March), when there happened such an eclipse of the sun as was never before nor since.'
In this year, on this particular day, the Council of Caesarea, AD 196 or 198, the Alexandrian Chronicle, Maximus Monachus, Nicephorus Constantinus, and Cedrenus all concur. Additionally, in this year, but on different dates, Eusebius and Epiphanius coincide, and they are followed by Kepler, Bucher, Patinus, and Petavius, some determining it to be the 10th of the Calends of April, others the 13th. (Refer to the commentary on Daniel 11: 22.) [8]
Herein lies the alignment of thirteen reliable authorities, who place the crucifixion of Christ in the spring of AD 31. We can thus confirm this as a definitive date. This event, positioned in the middle of the final week, allows us to reckon backward and forward three and a half years to discern the conclusion of the sixty-nine weeks and the completion of the entire seventy weeks respectively. By tracing back three and a half years from the crucifixion in the spring of AD 31, we arrive at the autumn of AD 27, which marks the conclusion of the sixty-nine weeks and the commencement of Christ's public ministry. Moving forward from the crucifixion by the same measure, we land upon the autumn of AD 34, the crucial concluding point of the entire seventy-week period. This date is distinguished by the martyrdom of Stephen, the explicit rejection of Christ's gospel by the Jewish Sanhedrin through the persecution of His disciples, and the apostles' turn towards the Gentiles. These are the anticipated events to occur when the specified period, allocated uniquely for the Jews, comes to its definite expiration.
Upon considering the facts detailed above, we discern a seamless harmony when the seventy weeks are calculated from the decree given to Ezra in the seventh year of Artaxerxes, 457 BC. Significant events such as the manifestation of the Messiah at His baptism, the commencement of His public ministry, the crucifixion, the rejection of the Jews, the evangelization of the Gentiles, and the proclamation of the new covenant all slot perfectly into their respective places, providing affirmation and certainty to the prophecy.
We have now completed the analysis of the seventy weeks, but there remains a lengthier period to consider, accompanied by other significant events. The seventy weeks constitute the initial 490 years of the 2300-year duration. Subtracting 490 from 2300 leaves 1810 years remaining. As established, the 490-year period ended in the autumn of AD 34. Adding the remaining 1810 years to this date reveals the termination of the entire period: the autumn of AD 1844. Once the seventy weeks have been located, we can rapidly and accurately find the conclusion of the 2300 days.
The question may arise as to why the days extend to the autumn of 1844 if they commenced in 457 BC, as it would only require an additional 1843 years to total 2300. Noting one particular fact will clear this discrepancy: it necessitates 457 complete years before Christ, and 1843 complete years after, to total 2300. Hence, if the period started on the very first day of 457, it would not terminate until the very last day of 1843. Clearly, if any part of the year 457 had passed before the 2300 days began, an equivalent part of the year 1844 must also pass before they end. Consequently, we question from which point in the year 457 we should start our calculations. As the initial forty-nine years were allocated to the building of the street and wall, we understand that the period should commence from the actual initiation of the work in Jerusalem, not from Ezra's departure from Babylon. The earliest this could have begun would likely be the seventh month (autumn) of 457, as Ezra did not reach Jerusalem until the fifth month of that year. (Ezra 7: 9.) Thus, the entire period would stretch to the seventh month, autumn, Jewish time, of 1844.
The profound declaration made by the angel to Daniel, Unto two thousand and three hundred days: then shall the sanctuary be cleansed, is now elucidated. In our quest to understand the meaning of the sanctuary, its purification, and the application of time, we have discovered not only that this topic can be easily comprehended, but that the event itself is currently unfolding. We pause momentarily to reflect upon the solemn situation we find ourselves in.
We have discerned that the sanctuary of the Christian Era is the heavenly tabernacle of God, a house not constructed by human hands, where our Lord advocates for repentant sinners. It is the place where a peaceful counsel prevails between the grand God and His Son Jesus Christ in the redemptive work for humanity on the brink of destruction (Zechariah 6: 13; Psalm 85: 10). We have understood that the cleansing of the sanctuary involves the removal of sins from it and is the final act of the ministry conducted within it. Salvation's work now centres in the heavenly sanctuary, and when the sanctuary is cleansed, the task is completed. At that point, the grand design of salvation, conceived at the fall of man, reaches its ultimate conclusion. Mercy no longer intercedes, and the majestic voice is heard from the throne in the heavenly temple, proclaiming, It is done. Revelation 16: 17. What follows? All the righteous are granted eternal life, and all the wicked are condemned to everlasting death. Beyond this point, no decision can be reversed, no reward can be forfeited, and no doomed fate can be evaded.


We have observed - an observation that casts the gravity of judgement upon our very doorstep - that the extensive prophetic period demarcating the commencement of the final heavenly sanctuary activities has reached its denouement. In 1844, the days were completed. Since that moment, the definitive work of humanity's salvation has been progressing. This task encompasses an examination of each person's character, for it entails absolution of the sins of those adjudged deserving of such mercy, and establishes who among the deceased shall be resurrected. It also decrees who among the living shall undergo transformation at the Lord's advent, and who among both the living and the deceased shall be consigned to endure the terrifying realities of the second death. It is apparent that such a judgement must be decreed prior to the Lord's appearance.
Each person's fate shall be determined by actions performed during their lifetime, with each individual to receive recompense in accordance with their deeds. (2 Corinthians 5: 10; Revelation 22: 12.) In the celestial ledgers maintained by the heavenly scribes, each individual's actions shall be catalogued. (Revelation 20: 12.) During the final phase of the sanctum's work, these records are scrutinized and decisions formulated based on their contents. (Daniel 7: 9, 10.) One would reasonably surmise that the process would initiate with the earliest members of the human race, with their cases being the first to undergo examination and judgement, and so forth with all the deceased, in chronological sequence, until we reach the final generation - the living - with whom the process would conclude.
The point at which the examination of all the deceased has been completed, and the process for the living commences, is unknown to any man. Yet, since 1844, this sobering work has been underway. Insight from the archetypes and the very nature of the work preclude a protracted duration. In his celestial visions, John saw legions of assistants cooperating with our Lord in his priestly duties. (Revelation 5.) Thus, the ministration progresses. It ceases not, it delays not, and it must soon be irrevocably concluded.
Hence, we find ourselves on the precipice of the final, the most profound, and the gravest crisis in the narrative of our species. The blueprint of salvation is nearing completion. The dwindling precious years of probation are almost expended. The Lord is poised to appear, to rescue those prepared and expectant, and to divide the heedless and faithless. Alas, the world! What can we utter of its state? Besieged with false beliefs, obsessed with cares and commerce, intoxicated with pleasure, and debilitated by vice, its inhabitants spare not a moment for pondering solemn truths, nor a thought for their everlasting fate. Let the followers of God, with eternity in sight, strive to evade the world's corruption through indulgence, and ready themselves to withstand the rigorous examination at the grand celestial tribunal. Let them be assiduous in cautioning sinners of impending judgement, and in guiding them towards a compassionate Savior who intercedes on their behalf.
We advocate for every prophecy scholar's careful examination of the sanctuary and its rites. In the sanctuary is viewed the ark of God's testament, housing His holy laws. This prompts a reconsideration of our obedience to this sublime moral compass. The initiation of this heavenly temple, or the commencement of service in its secondary chamber, signifies the onset of the seventh angel's sounding. (Revelation 11: 15, 19.) The work performed therein constitutes the basis of the third angel's message of Revelation 14, the final appeal for mercy to a doomed world. This topic of the sanctuary harmonizes and elucidates past prophetic fulfillments otherwise shrouded in impenetrable obscurity. It presents a clear understanding of the position and duties of our supreme High Priest, and highlights the plan of salvation in its distinctive and attractive aspects. It brings us, as no other subject does, to confront the reality of the judgement, revealing the preparation required to withstand the impending day. It demonstrates that we are in the waiting period, prompting vigilance, for we cannot ascertain how soon the work will be finalized, and our Lord appear. Be watchful, lest he appear suddenly and find you slumbering.
Upon stating the significant events associated with our Lord's earthly mission, the prophet in the closing portion of Daniel 9: 27 refers to the imminent devastation of Jerusalem by the Roman forces, and ultimately, the destruction of the Romans themselves, referred to in the margin as the desolator.
