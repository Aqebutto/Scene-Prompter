The seventeenth chapter of the Book of Revelation presents itself as a divine tapestry, weaving through the annals of time to depict the saga of the formidable power symbolized by the beast. This beast, witnessed by John as it emerged from the sea, is marked by its unique countenance, boasting seven heads and ten horns adorned with crowns. The Prophet Daniel, in his historical writings, approached the chronicles of the world through the lens of nations, occasionally intertwining his narrative with religious themes, with a particular focus on the people of God. However, his primary emphasis remained on the rise and fall of nations.

In contrast, the revelations bestowed upon John during his seclusion on the Isle of Patmos primarily unravel an ecclesiastical history. To fully fathom the series of events transpiring on this earthly realm, a harmonious study of both Daniel’s and John’s prophecies becomes imperative, as each serves to complete the other. As we navigate through the final epochs of world history, an intricate fusion of church and state becomes evident. It is within this context that John is granted a dual perspective, encompassing both the ecclesiastical and the political spheres, to grasp God's judgments manifested through the plagues truly.

These seven final plagues do not descend arbitrarily; they are the consequence of a distinct trajectory of actions. The Creator, in His infinite power, does not capriciously withhold mercy, inflicting torment upon mankind. Divine law, unveiled through the ages, stands in stark contrast to the course charted by men and nations, setting the stage for their own demise. The rise and fall of each nation throughout history serves as a poignant object lesson, illustrating the catastrophic results of prolonged defiance against the cosmic laws. These laws are the very fabric of the universe, dictating the conditions of its sustained existence.

Upon unveiling to John the cataclysmic events ensuing from the severance of the final thread of mercy between heaven and earth, an angel, bearing a vial of plagues, approaches the prophet. This celestial messenger elucidates the reasons behind the impending terrors. This angel, a steward of certain vital elements of life, has observed the ebb and flow of nations since the dawn of time. He has witnessed their ascent to glory, their transient prosperity, and their abrupt descent into oblivion, making way for the cyclical rise of new powers. Yet, amidst these historical tides, mankind remains unenlightened, neglecting the divine warnings and lessons embedded in these providential events.

Only a sparse number of individuals, spanning across generations, have attuned their ears to the celestial whispers, finding salvation in their heedfulness. Positioned in a secluded sanctuary, one of the seven angels, carrying vials of God’s wrath, transports John to a vantage point reminiscent of a mountain’s peak. From this elevated perspective, the prophet gains a panoramic view of history, discerning the intricate interrelations of all entities. There, he beholds the vision of a harlot, draped in opulence, adorned in purple and scarlet, and embellished with gold, precious stones, and pearls. In her hand, she holds a golden cup, brimming with the abominable filth of her sins.

Woman, in the grand tapestry of creation, stands as the pinnacle of the Creator's masterwork. As she emerged pristine from the divine hands, God Himself bestowed upon her the accolade of consummate perfection. The woman, elevated to the zenith, experiences the steepest descent in sin, and while her potential for benevolence knows no bounds under divine guidance, she possesses the power to lead men to the very precipice of damnation when her heart falls under satanic dominion. A virtuous woman serves as the emblem of Christ's church; conversely, a harlot embodies this sacred institution in moments of apostasy, when it strays from its rightful consort and fornicates with the earthly sovereigns.

The wife of the Lord is garbed in “fine linen, clean and white,” a stark contrast to the allure of purple and scarlet, gold, and precious stones that captivates the earthly gaze when her virtue is forsaken. God yearns for purity in life, whereas the world is in relentless pursuit of regal adornments and affluence. The harlot takes her seat upon a multitude of waters, wielding an influence that spans the breadth of nations and languages. The angel elucidates, “The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.”

From every corner of the globe, throngs are drawn to this ignominious entity, parting with their riches and partaking of the intoxicating brew from her golden chalice. Some, initially lured by curiosity, find themselves ensnared, their senses dulled by her potent libation. The imagery evokes scenes of ancient Babylon’s debauchery and the enigmatic rituals of Greece. “The kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.”

Emblazoned upon the harlot’s brow is a title, cryptic yet ominous: Mystery, Babylon The Great, The Mother Of Harlots And Abominations Of The Earth. This represents the enigma of wickedness, already at work in the apostle Paul’s era, as he warned the Thessalonians. The nascent church, depicted as an unblemished virgin in fine linen, undergoes a tragic metamorphosis. The narrative of the seven churches in Revelation's second and third chapters chronicles this descent.

The initial fervor of love dissipates, paving the way for spiritual infidelity. The church grows tolerant of false doctrines and succumbs to the intellectual seductions of Grecian philosophers, seeking to apply human reason to divine revelation. The simplicity of yore is forsaken for worldly customs, teachings, and lifestyles. This internal transformation finds its external manifestation in the churches of Pergamos and Thyatira. Paganism brazenly infiltrates the church, claiming the once-pure bride for itself.

A counterfeit prophetic spirit, misinterpretations of Scripture, the elevation of human reason, the allure of worldly ways, the quest for wealth and political power, and ultimately, the audacious demand for the crown itself—these are the forces that transmute the church from a state of purity, simplicity, and meekness to that of a spiritual harlot.

The metamorphosis of the church did not transpire overnight. For half a millennium following the commissioning of His initial disciples by Christ, this profound transformation steadily unfolded. Throughout this extensive period, Christ, in the role of a devoted spouse, tirelessly endeavored to reclaim His wayward church. “Thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to Me,” declares the Lord. “Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see where thou hast not been defiled. In the roads thou hast waited for them, like an Arabian in the desert; and thou hast defiled the land with thy lewdness and thy wickedness.” Despite this, the heavenly showers were withheld, resulting in a barren spiritual landscape. The church, unashamed in her debauchery, bore the brazen countenance of a harlot. Even after all this, the Lord implored, return to Me. Heed the divine entreaty to His people, and discern whether the Almighty derives any pleasure from the afflictions that befall them. “Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith the Lord; I will not look upon you in anger, for I am merciful,” declares the Lord, “I will not be angry forever.” Yet the church remained indifferent, advancing further astray during the reign of Constantine, ultimately aligning herself with the beast. She, once a golden chalice in the hands of the Lord, brimming with His love—a divine offering to the world—abandoned Him, adorning herself with worldly allure, and proffered a toxic brew to her devotees from her gilded chalice. She had fallen, and those who imbibed her poison fell alongside her.

For a span of twelve centuries, the harlot, entrenched in Rome—the city of seven hills—exerted her dominion over the nations of Europe, enticing them with her tainted wine. The masses partook liberally, indulging in her iniquities without reserve. However, those who dared to dissent paid the ultimate price in their own blood. The woman was drunk with the blood of the saints and the martyrs of Jesus. The woman that thou sawest is that great city, which holds sway over the kings of the earth. She represented the power that dominated Europe for a prophetic forty-two months, as foretold by Daniel: He shall speak pompous words against the Most High, wear out the saints of the Most High, and intend to change times and law. Then the saints shall be given into his hand for a time and times and half a time. This is a divinely inspired depiction of a church that began in purity but soon adulterated the true faith with pagan practices. Initially seeking aid from the nations, she eventually seized control of both the rulers and their realms. This church, denounced by God as a harlot and Mystery, Babylon the Great, the mother of harlots, stands as a tragic testament to spiritual apostasy.

Governments, instituted by divine decree, serve as ministers of God, administering justice to wrongdoers and benevolence to the righteous. As long as sin endures upon the earth, governance shall persist, albeit with a mandate limited to the realm of deeds, leaving thoughts and motives beyond its jurisdiction. To evildoers alone, governments are appointed as agents of divine terror. In all pagan societies, religious observance falls under the purview of the state, with deities venerated in accordance with governmental decrees. This held true across the heathen empires of Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome, until the advent of Christ. In each of these realms, Satan sought to obliterate the truth and those who clung to it. Their histories chronicle these relentless attempts, each regime constituting a satanic endeavor to rival the Creator's government. The resounding failure of these ventures laid bare the ignominy of the prince of this world before the celestial authorities, especially when Christ established His spiritual kingdom in the very heart of Rome. Upon the crucifixion of Christ, Satan, expelled from the assembly of world representatives and keenly aware that his time was dwindling, adopted a new strategy, subjugating governments to religious institutions. This seismic shift unfolded gradually, commencing shortly after Christ’s death. The master strategist, manipulating nations since the dawn of time, orchestrated a dual-front offensive, aspiring to achieve through this pincer movement what his previous endeavors had failed to accomplish.

In the epoch of the Savior, the Roman Empire stood as the undisputed sovereign of the globe. Throughout its evolution, it had experimented with every conceivable form of governance, amalgamating the most robust attributes from each of its predecessors. From monarchical rule to consuls, tribunes, decemvirs, triumvirs, and eventually undergoing a transformative revolution into an empire—each phase progressively ensnared the nation under the dominion of that dark prince who aspired to elevate his throne above that of the Almighty. The annals of Rome attest to this truth. The subjugation of the individual in favor of state supremacy was brought to near perfection in Rome, more so than in any other terrestrial regime.

Subsequently, the mystery of iniquity transmuted the church from a chaste bride into a fallen woman, positioning her atop the beast. This beast, characterized by its seven heads and ten horns, was synonymous with the governance of the Western Roman Empire, as delineated in the thirteenth chapter of Revelation and the seventh chapter of Daniel. Furthermore, an angelic interpreter revealed to John, “The seven heads are seven mountains”—a metaphor for governments, as utilized by Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Zechariah. The seven aforementioned governmental forms are implicated here. “And the ten horns ... are ten kings which have received no kingdom as yet.” These represent the ten subdivisions of the Roman Empire, foretold in Revelation 8, and depicted by the mingling of iron and clay in Daniel 2:42-44. This amalgamation set the stage for the woman, the church, to mount the beast. The formation of these divisions culminated prior to A.D. 476. Between A.D. 533, marked by Justinian’s decree acknowledging the ecclesiastical head in Rome, and A.D. 538, when the last competing power was eliminated in Italy, the woman ascended the beast. Henceforth, Rome, once exulting in its global dominion akin to ancient Babylon, found itself manipulated and dominated by a harlot. In the eyes of nations, this was deemed the epitome of degradation. A woman wielding such power had transgressed all boundaries of decency, while a nation under such subjugation forfeited its dignity. If this holds true in earthly relations, imagine the celestial perspective, witnessing the perversion of the very laws of nature to facilitate this deplorable state of affairs. Yet, the devil’s grand scheme was thwarted. Rome, engaging in a grotesque amalgamation contrary to divine law, was set on a path of self-destruction. The woman devolved into the mother of harlots, while the ten horns, or kingdoms, aligned their will with the beast, surrendering their power to it.

The woman was intoxicated with the blood of the saints, represented by the scarlet hue of the beast she rode. Rome, in its pagan state, was no stranger to bloodshed; all great empires rose to power through violence. However, neither the lion, the bear, nor the leopard of prophetic imagery bore the color scarlet. The nation was stained crimson with the blood of martyrs when it yielded to ecclesiastical authority, and the church waged war on the saints. Throughout the 1,260 years of oppression, the church maintained its innocence, claiming it never took a single life. It merely determined heresy, they argued, leaving the state to enact the judgment. Yet, the beast, once mounted by the woman, had no choice but to execute her will, transforming Rome into a scarlet-colored beast.

To dispel any potential confusion regarding the scarlet beast, the angel elucidated further, describing it to John as “the beast that was, and is not, and yet is; even he is the eighth, and is of the seven.” Throughout the reigns of the first five heads, paganism dominated; in the sixth, the empire, it continued to reign supreme; during the papacy, the seventh, it seemed to vanish outwardly but remained the puppet master, for the papacy itself is nothing but paganism in a baptized guise.

In the aftermath of the Reformation, when the harlot found herself scorned by the horns, the papal authority crumbled. Yet, as the end times approach, we shall witness the resurgence of pagan principles manifested supremely in Spiritualism. Its climax will be marked by the devil's audacious impersonation of Christ Himself, along with the resurgence of papal dominance and the deceitful false prophet. These daughters of Babylon, offspring of the arch-harlot, will once again rise to prominence, wielding their power to persecute God’s chosen ones. United, these forces will convene at Armageddon, whereupon them God’s plagues shall be unleashed. They emerge from the abyss, alien to God and devoid of heavenly standing; they are destined for destruction, having brazenly challenged the Sovereign of Heaven. Forsaking every tenet of life, they suffer a harlot's demise, their own deeds cursing them, tainting all they touched with their vile contagion.

These regimes have perpetually stood in stark opposition to the Lamb. God, in His mercy, dispatched prophets, sages, and even His beloved Son to them, yet they responded with violence, spilling innocent blood. In the day of His glorious return, they shall be obliterated by the sheer brilliance of His presence. Truth, once unrestrained and ablaze in its full potency, eradicates falsehood, consigning the beast, its image, and the deceitful prophet to the infernal lake of fire. Alongside them plunges the Dragon, the ancient Serpent, and Satan himself—the puppeteer who orchestrated this rebellion against the God of truth and love. This narrative captures the tumultuous saga, and this marks the grim finale of the unholy alliance between Church and State.


Dear viewers, I will make thorough breakdowns of Revelation 17 and 18, but until then, know this:
The Battle of Armageddon is drawing near, and we can see the signs even in the news. The 10 horns of Revelation 17:12 are ready to give their power unto the 8th king—he who is of the 7 kings. 

We are called to delve deeply into the mysteries surrounding the outpouring of the seventh vial. The forces of malevolence will not relinquish their grip on the conflict effortlessly. However, Providence has an essential role to play in the epic showdown of Armageddon. As the earth becomes illuminated with the splendor of Revelation eighteen’s angel, the religious factions, embodying both virtue and vice, will rouse from their dormant state, and the legions of the Almighty will mobilize for battle.

Four celestial beings exert their might to restrain the worldly powers until the divine seal is imprinted upon the foreheads of God’s servants. The global nations, now teetering on the edge of strife, are held at bay by these heavenly guardians. Yet, once this celestial barricade is lifted, an era of turmoil and suffering will ensue. Instruments of destruction, unparalleled in their lethality, will be conceived. Ships, bearing their precious human freight, will find their graves in the ocean’s abyss. Those devoid of the spirit of truth will rally under the banners of demonic forces. Nevertheless, they shall remain under divine restraint until the appointed time for the monumental clash at Armageddon arrives.

Every manifestation of wickedness is poised to erupt in vehement intensity. Demonic entities will forge alliances with malevolent humans. Having engaged in incessant warfare, honing their skills in deception and combat through the ages, and amassing strength over centuries, they will not easily cede the battlefield in this ultimate, decisive confrontation. Humanity will find itself polarized, compelled to choose sides in this grand cosmic struggle. The battle of Armageddon looms, and it is imperative that it catches none of us in slumber. We must remain vigilant and prudent, like the wise virgins, our lamps filled with oil, ready to meet what lies ahead...
