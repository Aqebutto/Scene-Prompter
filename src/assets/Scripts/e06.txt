When stripped of all its subterfuge, it merely establishes a spurious Sabbath of its own on the first day of the week, in lieu of the Lord's Sabbath on the seventh day. This is a usurpation that the supreme God cannot endure, and from which the remnant church must wholly extricate itself before it is ready for the Second Coming of Christ. Thus, the impassioned warning: Let no man venerate the beast or accept his mark.
The third message speaks against the veneration of the beast's image. Consequently, this movement likewise addresses this subject, revealing the nature of the image, or at the very least, interpreting the prophecy of the two-horned beast. It discloses the location of the formation of the image. The prophecy pertains to this generation; its fulfillment appears imminent.

There exists no religious endeavor at present, apart from that of the Seventh-day Adventists, claiming to be an embodiment of the third angel's message - none which primarily espouses the very themes encapsulated within this manuscript. How should we interpret these facts? Is this truly the fulfillment? Such must be the case unless its assertions can be debunked: unless it can be demonstrated that the messages of the first and second angels have not been broadcast; that the stances taken concerning the beast, the image, the mark, and the worship are not accurate; and that all the prophecies, signs, and evidences suggesting the imminent arrival of Christ, and therefore the due timing of this message, can be entirely dismissed. Such a task would not be lightly undertaken by the discerning student of the Bible.
The outcome of this proclamation, as articulated in verse 12, further affirms the validity of the positions adopted here. It gathers a group of individuals to whom it can be declared, "Here are they that keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus." Within the very nucleus of Christendom, this work is being accomplished, and those who embrace the message are made distinct by their adherence to God's commandments. What distinguishes their practice, and what is the only distinction among Christians in this regard? Merely this: some believe that the fourth commandment is upheld by dedicating the first day of the week to rest and worship. Others assert that the seventh day is the one designated for such activities, and they arrange their time accordingly, resuming their regular labor on the first day. No clearer division could be drawn between two groups. The time that one group considers sacred and devotes to religious pursuits, the other views as entirely secular and dedicates to ordinary labor. One group, engaged in their worldly occupations, finds the other group withdrawn from all such endeavors, and the path of commercial interaction between them abruptly shut. Thus, for two days each week, these two groups are separated by their differing beliefs and practices concerning the fourth commandment. No other commandment could create such a noticeable division.
The Emphasis of the Sabbath in the Message. The third angel's message compels its followers to observe the seventh day, for only in this way are they made distinctive, given that the observance of the first day would not distinguish an individual from the multitude who were already observing that day when the message was introduced. In this, we find additional proof that Sunday observance is the mark of the beast, for the message, with its central focus on a warning against accepting the mark of the beast, will naturally lead its followers to reject the practice that constitutes the mark, and to adopt the opposite course. It indeed prompts them to abandon the observance of the first day of the week, and adopt that of the seventh day. In light of this, it becomes immediately apparent that there is more than an inference that Sunday observance is the mark of the beast against which we are warned, and that the observance of the seventh day stands in opposition to it.
This aligns with the argument on the seal of God, as presented in the commentary on Revelation 7. It was demonstrated there that sign, seal, mark, and token are interchangeable terms, and that God designates His Sabbath as His sign, or seal, in relation to His people. Therefore, God has a seal, which is His Sabbath. The beast has a mark, which is a counterfeit Sabbath. One is the seventh day, the other the first day. Christendom will ultimately be divided into precisely two classes: those sealed with the seal of the living God – that is, possessing His sign, or observing His Sabbath; and those who receive the mark of the beast – that is, possessing his sign , or observing his counterfeit Sabbath. With regard to this division, the third angel's message enlightens and cautions us.
Given the considerable significance attached to the seventh-day Sabbath, it is appropriate to bring forward the principal facts associated with the Sabbath institution. The Sabbath was established at the outset, at the closure of the first week of time (Genesis 2:1-3).
It was the seventh day of that week, and was grounded in truths that are indelibly linked with its name and existence - truths that can never be altered. God's cessation of labor on the seventh day christened it His day of rest, or the Sabbath (rest) of the Lord; it can never cease to be His day of rest, as that truth can never be revised. He sanctified, or set apart, the day at that time and place, as the record denotes; and that sanctification can never cease unless it is rescinded by an act from Jehovah as overt and unequivocal as that by which He conferred it upon the day at the outset. No one purports that this has ever occurred, and one would be hard-pressed to substantiate it if they did make such a claim.

The Sabbath possesses nothing of a typical or ceremonial nature, for it was instituted before mankind sinned, and thus belongs to a time when, by the very nature of things, a symbol or shadow could not exist.

The laws and precepts established before humanity's fall were primal in their essence, deriving from the relationship between God and man, and man and his fellow man. Such principles, untouched by man's sin, would have remained ever constant if man had never transgressed, for they are innately unchanging and eternal. Ceremonial and typical laws, on the other hand, arose as a consequence of man's sin, and were subject to alteration throughout different epochs; these alone were nullified at the cross. The Sabbath law, being a primal law, thus remains immutable and eternal.
The sanctification of the Sabbath in Eden underscores its continuity from creation to Sinai. Here, it was enshrined in the heart of the Decalogue as God's vocal proclamation and inscribed by His finger on tablets of stone—a distinction that forever distinguishes it from ceremonial laws and aligns it with the moral and eternal.
The Sabbath is not an arbitrary seventh day following six days of labor. The law from Sinai (Exodus 20: 8-11) precisely defines it. The events that initiated it (Genesis 2:1-3) restrict it to the specific seventh day. The 6,240 Sabbath miracles in the wilderness—three each week for forty years, a double portion of manna on the sixth day, preservation of the sixth-day manna on the seventh, and none on the seventh day (Exodus 16)—confirm that it is a particular day, not merely a ratio of time. To argue otherwise would parallel suggesting that Washington's Birthday or Independence Day represents only a 365th part of a year and could be commemorated on any day.
The Sabbath is a component of that law which our Lord emphatically announced He did not come to obliterate. Contrarily, He solemnly affirmed that it should persist in every detail while the earth remains (Matthew 5: 17-20). It is an element of that royal law, associated with King Jehovah, which James declares as a law of liberty, and which shall judge us on the final day. God does not employ different judgment standards for varying epochs of the world (James 2: 11, 12). It is the "Lord's day" of Revelation 1:10.
The Sabbath reemerges as a significant institution regarding which significant reform is forecasted in the final days (Isaiah 56:1,2 compared with 1 Peter 1:5). In the forthcoming creation, the Sabbath, true to its genesis and nature, reappears, bestowing its blessings upon God's people throughout eternity (Isaiah 66:22,23).
This concise review of arguments demonstrates that the Sabbath law remains undiminished and the institution remains unaltered; and a person cannot claim to adhere to God's commandments unless he honors His day. Engaging with such an institution is a profound honor. Heeding its stipulations will confer limitless blessings.
Retribution for Beast Worshipers. These shall suffer torment with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and the Lamb. When is this torment inflicted? Revelation 19:20 indicates that at the Second Coming of Christ, there's a manifestation of fiery judgments, described as a lake of fire and brimstone, into which the beast and the false prophet are cast alive. This can only refer to the destruction inflicted at the outset, not at the conclusion, of the thousand years.
There's an extraordinary passage in Isaiah that explicates the phraseology of the third angel's threat, undoubtedly portraying scenes unfolding at the second advent and in the desolate state of the earth during the subsequent thousand years. The likelihood that Revelation's language was inspired by this prophecy is substantial. The prophet, after illustrating the Lord's wrath upon nations, the immense slaughter of their armies, and the heavens departing like a scroll, proclaims: "It is the day of the Lord's vengeance, and the year of recompenses for the controversy of Zion. And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch. It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up forever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it forever and ever." Isaiah 34: 8-10. Given the explicit revelation of a lake of fire where all sinners shall perish at the conclusion of the thousand years, we can deduce that the destruction of the living wicked at the onset of this era, and the ultimate fate of all the impious at its end, are mirror images of each other.

The phrase "forever and ever" is not an assertion of eternity in this context. The evidence for this assertion lies in the nature of the punishment meted out on this earth, where the passage of time is marked by the cyclical transition of day into night. Further evidence may be drawn from the passage in Isaiah mentioned above, assuming this is the linguistic root from which the present text is derived and that it pertains to the same chronological context. The land of Idumea is the direct object of the prophecy in Isaiah, and whether this term is interpreted literally as the region of Edom, located southeast of Judea, or symbolically as a representation of the entire earth during the apocalyptic revelation of Lord Jesus in a cascade of celestial flames, the scene is ultimately transient. This earth is destined to undergo a transformation, purged of every trace of sin, every remnant of suffering and decay, to emerge as a new dwelling place of righteousness and joy for all eternity. The Greek word "αιων", translated here as "forever", is defined by G. Abbot-Smith in A Manual Greek Lexicon of the New Testament as "a space of time, as, a lifetime, generation, period of history, an indefinitely long period". Therefore, without distorting the accepted meaning of the Greek term, we can interpret it in a manner that aligns with other unambiguous scriptural statements.
The temporal span of the third angel's message is characterized as a period of patience for the faithful. Both Paul and James provide guidance on this matter (Hebrews 10: 36; James 5: 7, 8). During this period of waiting, the faithful keep the commandments of God - the ten commandments - and the faith of Jesus, which encompasses all the teachings of Christ and His apostles as contained in the New Testament. The authentic Sabbath, as outlined in the decalogue, stands in stark contrast with the counterfeit Sabbath, the mark of the beast, which ultimately distinguishes those who reject the third angel's message.

The gravity of events intensifies as we approach the culmination. This very reality lends the third angel's message, currently being disseminated, its extraordinary solemnity and significance. It is the final cautionary voice to be heard before the advent of the Son of Man, who is depicted here seated upon a pristine white cloud, adorned with a crown, and wielding a sickle, ready to reap the earth's harvest.
We are rapidly traversing a prophetic trajectory that culminates in the fiery revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven, exacting retribution upon His adversaries and bestowing rewards upon His saints. Furthermore, we have ventured so close to the fulfillment of this prophecy that the next inevitable link in the chain is this climactic and consequential event. Time, like a relentless river, never retreats. As rivers do not hesitate when faced with a precipice but force all floating bodies over with unyielding power; and as the seasons never deviate from their ordained course, with summer faithfully pursuing the budding fig tree, and winter swiftly following the descent of the falling leaf; we too are carried forward ceaselessly, willingly or not, prepared or unprepared, towards the inescapable and irrevocable crisis. The doom that looms large remains unimaginably distant to both the ostentatious believer and the indifferent sinner, and even those who understand and profess the truth struggle to truly apprehend its imminent reality.
A Blessing Foretold. A voice from heaven commands John to inscribe, "Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth;" and the Spirit's concurrence is, "Yea, . . . that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them." "From henceforth" implies a specific point in time. Which point, precisely? Evidently, it denotes the inception of the message with which this is spoken. But why are those who perish subsequent to this moment blessed? This benediction must carry a distinct rationale. Is it not due to the fact that they evade the period of formidable danger that the saints confront as they conclude their journey? While they share this blessing with all righteous deceased, they undoubtedly hold a unique position as the group who are resurrected to eternal life in the specific resurrection prophesied in Daniel 12: 2.
Observing this prophetic trajectory, one notes that three angels preface the arrival of the Son of Man on the white cloud, and three more appear subsequently. The belief has been previously articulated that these are literal angels participating in the scenes described here. The first trio is entrusted with the three distinctive messages. The fourth angel's message appears to be voiced after the Son of Man completes His priestly duties and assumes His position on the white cloud, but before He manifests Himself in the heavenly clouds. This call to prayer from the church, once their work for the world is completed, the window of redemption has closed, and nothing remains but for the Lord to manifest and gather His people to Himself, resonates in the plea that our Lord references in Luke 18: 7, 8, associated with the arrival of the Son of Man. This plea will be answered; the chosen ones will be vindicated; for does the parable not declare, "Shall not God avenge His own elect, which cry day and night unto Him?" He who sits upon the cloud will thrust His sickle, and the saints, represented as the wheat of the earth, will be harvested into the heavenly storehouse.
"He that sat on the cloud," declares the prophecy, "thrust in His sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped." With these words, we are transported beyond the second coming, transcending its concomitant scenes of cataclysm for the wicked and salvation for the virtuous. Thus, we must look past these scenes to discern the application of the ensuing verses.


The closing angels in this prophetic tableau are concerned primarily with the fate of the wicked, aptly symbolized by the dark, robust clusters of the earth's vine. Might it be inferred, then, that the final condemnation of such individuals at the terminus of the thousand-year period is portrayed here? It would seem that this prophecy is methodically crafting a conclusive disposition for both the virtuous and the wicked: the virtuous garbed in immortality and securely ensconced within the kingdom, and the wicked meeting their demise beyond the city's confines.
Application of this prophecy to the period of the second advent is improbable, considering the chronological sequence of events that is presented. For, the obliteration of the wicked would coincide with the gathering of the righteous. Furthermore, the living wicked experience the wrath of Christ's "cup" during His advent. Yet, this passage elucidates the moment when they suffer in the "winepress" of His wrath, said to be tread "without the city", a portrayal aligning perfectly with Revelation 20: 9. This phrase seems to signify their comprehensive and ultimate annihilation.
The angel materializes from the temple, the repository of records and the place where penalties are decreed. His companion angel holds dominion over fire. This might have some relation to the fact that the ultimate annihilation of the wicked is executed through fire. To maintain the metaphor, the wicked are compared to clusters of the vine of the earth, destined to be thrown into the vast winepress trodden outside the city. Blood flows from the winepress, reaching up to the horses' bridles. The fate of the wicked is to be consumed by an overwhelming deluge of divine flame from the heavens. As to what preliminary carnage might occur within this doomed populace, we are left in uncertainty. It is not inconceivable that this prophecy may come to pass in a literal sense. Just as the first four angels signified a prominent shift amongst God's people, the final two could herald a similar shift. For the saints, it seems, are to partake in administering and executing the ultimate penalty on the wicked (1 Corinthians 6: 2; Psalm 149: 9).
This prophecy concludes as others have: with the unequivocal triumph of God, Christ, and the redeemed.
