Originally, humanity was graced with exalted capabilities and a mind of harmonious balance. In his primeval state, man was the epitome of perfection and in symphony with the Divine. His contemplations were untainted, his intentions sacred. Yet, through acts of disobedience, his faculties were corrupted, and egocentrism supplanted altruism. His essence, so debilitated by transgression, rendered him powerless in his solitary might to counteract the forces of malevolence. Ensnared by the deceiver, his bondage would have been eternal, were it not for the Divine's extraordinary intervention. The deceiver aimed to subvert the celestial scheme in human genesis, and to inundate the world with sorrow and ruin. He would then attribute all this malevolence to the Divine's act of creating humanity.

In his pristine, sinless condition, man joyously engaged with Him in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. Colossians 2:3. However, post-transgression, he no longer reveled in sanctity and sought to evade the Divine presence. This mirrors the plight of the unregenerated soul, not in consonance with the Divine, devoid of pleasure in such communion. The sinner would find no bliss in the Divine's presence, recoiling from the fellowship of the sanctified. Were he to enter paradise, it would hold no delight for him. The prevailing essence of selfless love there—each soul echoing the Infinite Love—would resonate not with his being. His aspirations, interests, and incentives would be foreign to those animating the sinless inhabitants. In the celestial chorus, he would be a jarring dissonance. Paradise, to him, would transform into an abode of anguish; he would yearn to be concealed from the One who embodies its radiance and joy's nucleus. It is not a capricious edict of the Divine that bars the wicked from paradise; rather, it is their own incompatibility with its fellowship. The Divine's splendor would be an annihilating blaze to them. They would embrace oblivion, longing to be veiled from the gaze of the One who sacrificed Himself for their redemption.
It is beyond our solitary capability to extricate ourselves from the abyss of sin in which we are deeply entrenched. Our hearts are marred by iniquity, and the transformation of their nature eludes us. Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one. The carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. Job 14:4; Romans 8:7. Education and culture, the exertion of willpower, and mortal endeavors, all hold their significance, yet in this realm, they find themselves impotent. They might manifest an external adherence to propriety, but the heart's intrinsic nature, the wellspring of life, remains untouched. There must be an intrinsic force, a transcendent rebirth, before humanity can transition from sinfulness to sanctity. That force is Christ. Only His grace can revitalize the dormant aspects of the soul and draw it towards God, towards sanctity.

The Saviour proclaimed, Except a man be born from above, unless he embraces a renewed heart, new aspirations, intentions, and motivations, leading to a transformed existence, he cannot see the kingdom of God. John 3:3, margin. The notion that merely nurturing the innate goodness within man suffices, is a perilous fallacy. The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. 1 Corinthians 2:14; John 3:7. Of Christ, it is declared, In Him was life; and the life was the light of men—the sole name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. John 1:4; Acts 4:12.

Merely acknowledging the magnanimity of God, recognizing the benevolence and paternal compassion of His nature, is insufficient. It is not enough to comprehend the wisdom and righteousness of His law, to acknowledge that it is rooted in the eternal essence of love. The apostle Paul perceived all this when he declared, I consent unto the law that it is good. The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. Yet, he confessed, amidst the depths of his soul's torment and desolation, I am carnal, sold under sin. Romans 7:16, 12, 14. He yearned for the sanctity and virtue that were beyond his own reach and lamented, O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from this body of death? Romans 7:24, margin. Such is the lamentation that has ascended from burdened souls across all nations and through all epochs.

For all, a singular response resounds: Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. John 1:29.

Various are the metaphors employed by the Divine Spirit to elucidate this profound truth, aiming to enlighten those souls yearning for liberation from the oppressive weight of guilt. When Jacob, having deceived Esau, departed from his paternal abode, he was burdened with profound guilt. In his isolation and estrangement, far from all that he cherished, the predominant fear haunting his spirit was that his transgression had severed him from the Divine, leaving him abandoned by the heavens. In melancholy, he reclined upon the barren earth, surrounded by solitary hills, under a canopy of star-illumined skies. In his slumber, a wondrous vision unfolded; a colossal, shadowy staircase appeared, extending from his resting place to the celestial gates, with God's angels traversing up and down; while from the resplendent heavens above, a divine voice offered words of consolation and hope. Thus, the revelation to Jacob addressed the deep longing of his soul—a Redeemer. With elation and thankfulness, he perceived a path revealed, whereby he, a sinner, might regain communion with the Divine. The enigmatic ladder in his dream symbolized Jesus, the sole conduit between God and humanity.

This imagery resonates with Christ's words to Nathanael: Ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man. John 1:51. In apostasy, humanity distanced itself from God; earth was severed from heaven. No communion could span this chasm. However, through Christ, earth reunites with heaven. Christ, with His own virtues, has spanned the chasm wrought by sin, enabling angelic beings to commune with humanity. Christ bridges the gap between fallen humanity, in its frailty and impotence, and the wellspring of boundless power.

Yet, all human aspirations for progress, all endeavors towards humanity's elevation, are futile if they overlook the sole source of hope and aid for the fallen race. Every good gift and every perfect gift (James 1:17) emanates from the Divine. True nobility of character is unattainable independent of Him. And the only path to the Divine is through Christ. He declares, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me. John 14:6.
The heart of the Divine harbors an affection for His earthly progeny, an affection more potent than death itself. In the sacrifice of His Son, He has bestowed upon us the entirety of the celestial realm in a singular, magnanimous offering. The Redeemer's existence, His ultimate sacrifice and ceaseless intercession, the ministrations of angelic beings, the Spirit's earnest entreaties, the Father's omnipresent influence, and the unending dedication of heavenly entities—each aspect is wholeheartedly committed to the salvation of mankind.

Let us deeply ponder the unparalleled sacrifice made for our sake! May we endeavor to understand the immense effort and vitality that the Heavens expend in their quest to recover the lost and reunite them with the paternal abode. Could there be motivations more compelling, or mechanisms more potent, than these in action? The bountiful rewards for righteousness, the bliss of the celestial realm, the fellowship with angels, the intimate communion and affection of the Divine and His Son, the augmentation and perpetuation of all our faculties across the boundless expanse of eternity—do these not present formidable incentives and inspirations, urging us to dedicate our hearts in loving service to our Creator and Redeemer?

Conversely, the Divine decrees against iniquity, the unavoidable consequences, the diminishment of our character, and the ultimate annihilation, are vividly portrayed in the Divine scriptures to dissuade us from the path of the adversary. Shall we not heed the mercy of the Divine? What greater acts could He perform? Let us align ourselves with Him who has bestowed upon us love of astonishing magnitude. Let us embrace the means made available to us so that we might be transfigured into His likeness, and reinstated into communion with the ministering angels, and into harmonious concord with the Father and the Son.
How can a man attain righteousness before God? How can a sinner be rendered just? It is solely through Christ that we can achieve consonance with God, with sanctity; but what is the path to Christ? Many echo the query of the throng on the Day of Pentecost, who, deeply convicted of their transgressions, implored, What shall we do? The foremost element of Peter's response was, Repent. Acts 2:37, 38. On a subsequent occasion, he further elaborated, Repent, ... and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out. Acts 3:19.

True repentance encompasses both a heartfelt sorrow for sin and a decisive turning away from it. We cannot forsake sin without recognizing its heinousness; until we genuinely abandon it in spirit, there will be no substantive transformation in our conduct.

There exists a widespread misunderstanding regarding the essence of repentance. Numerous individuals express regret for their sins and might even undertake superficial reforms out of apprehension that their misdeeds will bring personal affliction. However, this does not constitute repentance in the biblical context. Their remorse is more about the potential suffering than the sin itself. Such was Esau's despair when he realized the irreversible loss of his birthright. Balaam, confronted by the angel barring his path with an unsheathed sword, admitted his wrongdoing, not out of a true change of heart, but rather to preserve his life; his contrition was devoid of genuine repentance for sin, a transformation of intent, or a loathing of wickedness. Judas Iscariot, following his betrayal of his Master, declared, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. Matthew 27:4.

His confession was wrung from a soul besieged by overwhelming guilt and a dread anticipation of judgment. The impending consequences that awaited him filled him with dread, yet there was no profound, soul-rending sorrow within him for having betrayed the immaculate Son of God and denied the Holy One of Israel. Pharaoh, under the infliction of divine judgments, admitted his sin merely to avert further chastisement, only to revert to his defiance of the Divine once the plagues ceased. All of these individuals grieved the repercussions of their sins, but they did not truly lament the sins themselves.
When the human heart surrenders to the sway of the Divine Spirit, the conscience becomes invigorated, allowing the sinner to perceive the profound gravity and sanctity of God’s holy law, the cornerstone of His dominion in both heaven and earth. The Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world, casts its rays into the soul’s most hidden recesses, revealing what lurks in obscurity. John 1:9. Thus, conviction grips both mind and heart. The sinner acquires an awareness of Jehovah’s righteousness and experiences the dread of standing, tainted by his own faults and impurities, before the One who scrutinizes hearts. He beholds the benevolence of God, the allure of sanctity, the bliss of purity; he yearns to be purified and reinstated into fellowship with the celestial.

The supplication of David following his downfall epitomizes genuine contrition for sin. His remorse was profound and heartfelt. There was no attempt to downplay his wrongdoing; nor was his plea motivated by a wish to evade the impending judgment. David recognized the enormity of his offense; he saw the contamination of his soul and abhorred his transgression. His entreaty was not solely for absolution but for inner sanctification. He aspired for the delight of holiness—to be realigned with the Divine and restored to communion with God. This was the earnest plea of his spirit:
Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity,
And in whose spirit there is no guile.
Psalm 32:1, 2.
Have mercy upon me, O God, according to Thy loving-kindness:
According unto the multitude of Thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions....
For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.
Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow....
Create in me a clean heart, O God; And renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from Thy presence; And take not Thy Holy Spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation; And uphold me with Thy free spirit....
Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, Thou God of my salvation:
And my tongue shall sing aloud of Thy righteousness.
Psalm 51:1-14.
Such repentance, profound and transformative, lies beyond the realm of our own capabilities; it is bestowed solely by Christ, who ascended on high and granted gifts unto humanity.
At this juncture, there is a pivotal misunderstanding that may lead many astray, preventing them from embracing the aid Christ is eager to offer. They are under the impression that they must first repent before approaching Christ, believing that such repentance paves the way for the absolution of their sins. Indeed, repentance does antecede the forgiveness of sins, for only a heart wrought with contrition perceives the necessity of a Redeemer. But is it requisite for the sinner to delay his approach to Jesus until he has repented? Should repentance be construed as a barrier between the sinner and the Savior?

The Scriptures do not endorse the notion that repentance is a prerequisite to heeding Christ’s call, Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest. Matthew 11:28. It is Christ’s own virtue that engenders true repentance. Peter elucidated this to the Israelites, proclaiming, Him hath God exalted with His right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins. Acts 5:31. We are as incapable of repenting without Christ’s Spirit to stir our conscience as we are of receiving pardon without Christ himself.

Christ is the wellspring of all righteous impulses. He alone can instill in the heart a profound aversion to sin. Each longing for truth and purity, each acknowledgment of our own sinful nature, is a testament that His Spirit is at work within us.

Jesus declared, I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto Me. John 12:32. It is in the revelation of Christ as the Saviour, sacrificing Himself for the world's sins, that the enigma of redemption begins to unravel in our minds, and God’s benevolence guides us towards repentance. In His sacrifice for sinners, Christ demonstrated an unfathomable love; as the sinner witnesses this love, it mollifies the heart, influences the mind, and evokes remorse in the soul.

It is factual that individuals sometimes abandon their sinful practices and forsake certain vices before realizing they are being drawn towards Christ. Yet, whenever they strive for reform, motivated by a genuine yearning to do right, it is Christ’s influence that beckons them. An unseen force acts upon their being, enlivening the conscience and improving the external life. As Christ draws them to gaze upon His cross, to witness the One whom their transgressions have afflicted, the commandment resonates with their conscience. The profundity of their sinful existence, the entrenched sin of their soul, becomes apparent. They begin to grasp the righteousness of Christ, pondering, What is sin, that it necessitated such a sacrifice for its redemption? Was this vast expanse of love, suffering, and humility demanded so that we might not perish, but have eternal life?

The sinner might defy this love, may decline to be drawn towards Christ; but if he does not resist, he will be drawn to Jesus. A comprehension of the salvation plan will lead him to the foot of the cross, repenting for his sins, which inflicted suffering upon God’s beloved Son.
The same celestial intellect that orchestrates the workings of nature is also resonating within the hearts of humankind, igniting an indefinable yearning for something elusive, something beyond their current grasp. Earthly possessions and worldly delights fail to quench this deep thirst. The Spirit of God gently entreats them to seek those elements that can truly bestow serenity and respite—the grace of Christ, the bliss of sanctity. Through both visible and invisible influences, our Redeemer ceaselessly endeavors to divert human minds from the fleeting joys of sin towards the boundless blessings accessible in Him. To all those souls aimlessly attempting to satiate themselves at the fractured wellsprings of this world, the divine edict is proclaimed, Let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. Revelation 22:17.

You, who inwardly yearn for something superior to what this terrestrial realm can offer, perceive this longing as the divine call to your spirit. Entreat Him to bestow upon you repentance, to unveil Christ in His boundless love, in His immaculate purity. In the life of the Saviour, the tenets of God’s law—devotion to both God and fellow beings—were flawlessly personified. Benevolence, the essence of selfless love, was the lifeblood of His being. It is in our contemplation of Him, as the illumination from our Saviour radiates upon us, that we discern the sinfulness of our own hearts.

We might have deluded ourselves, akin to Nicodemus, into believing in the rectitude of our conduct, in the integrity of our moral character, and suppose that we need not bow our hearts before God as does the ordinary transgressor. Yet, when the light from Christ pierces our souls, we recognize our impurity; we perceive the selfish motives, the antagonism towards God, tainting every deed. Then we understand that our supposed righteousness is, indeed, akin to filthy rags, and that only the blood of Christ has the power to cleanse us from sin’s stain and reshape our hearts in His image.

A single beam of God's glory, a mere glimpse of Christ's purity penetrating the soul, vividly highlights every stain of corruption, unveiling the flaws and deficiencies of human nature. It reveals the profane desires, the faithlessness of the heart, the impurity of speech. The acts of rebellion against God’s law committed by the sinner are laid bare before his eyes, and his spirit is overwhelmed and afflicted under the penetrating influence of the Spirit of God. He abhors his own being as he beholds the pristine, unblemished character of Christ.
When the prophet Daniel witnessed the resplendent glory enveloping the celestial messenger sent to him, he was profoundly aware of his own frailty and shortcomings. In reflecting upon the impact of this awe-inspiring encounter, he states, There remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength. Daniel 10:8. A soul thus affected will despise its own egocentrism, loathe its self-adulation, and will earnestly seek, through the righteousness of Christ, the purity of heart that aligns with God’s law and emulates the character of Christ.

Paul acknowledges that regarding the righteousness which is in the law—in terms of external actions—he was blameless (Philippians 3:6). Yet, upon comprehending the spiritual essence of the law, he recognized his sinfulness. By the standards of the law as it is conventionally applied to external conduct, he had refrained from sin. However, when he peered into the profound sanctity of its precepts and saw his true reflection through God's eyes, he humbled himself and admitted his transgressions. He remarks, I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. Romans 7:9. Recognizing the law’s spiritual depth, sin’s true abhorrence became clear, and his self-regard evaporated.

God does not perceive all transgressions as equally grave; in His eyes, as in humans', there are varying degrees of guilt. Regardless of how insignificant certain misdeeds may appear to human perspective, no sin is trivial in God's view. Human judgment is inherently limited and flawed, but God discerns all things in their true essence. The inebriate is scorned and warned of his exclusion from heaven, while sins like pride, egotism, and greed often escape censure. Yet, these are the transgressions that most grievously offend God; they are antithetical to the generosity intrinsic to His nature, to the selfless love that permeates the realm of the unfallen. Those who commit more overt sins may be acutely aware of their disgrace and poverty, and their need for Christ’s grace. However, pride perceives no deficiency, thereby barricading the heart against Christ and the boundless blessings He offers.
The humble tax collector who implored, God be merciful to me a sinner (Luke 18:13), perceived himself as exceedingly sinful, a view echoed by those around him. Yet, acutely aware of his shortcomings, he approached the Divine with his burden of guilt and disgrace, seeking mercy. His heart was receptive to the transformative work of the Spirit of God, freeing him from sin's dominion. In stark contrast, the Pharisee's self-aggrandizing prayer revealed a heart impervious to the Holy Spirit's influence. His estrangement from the Divine left him oblivious to his own impurities, especially when contrasted with the impeccable holiness of the Divine. Feeling no sense of lack, he consequently received nothing.

If you recognize your sinfulness, do not delay in an attempt to reform yourself. Countless individuals believe they are too flawed to approach Christ. Do you anticipate self-improvement through your own endeavors? Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil. Jeremiah 13:23. Our sole recourse lies in the Divine. We mustn't wait for more compelling persuasions, more opportune moments, or more sanctified dispositions. We are powerless on our own. We must approach Christ precisely as we are.

However, let no one be deluded into thinking that God, in His immense love and mercy, will ultimately redeem even those who spurn His grace. The profound wickedness of sin is only truly comprehensible in the context of the cross. When individuals assert that God is too benevolent to forsake the sinner, they should reflect on Calvary. The necessity of this sacrifice lay in the fact that without it, humanity could not be extricated from sin’s corrupting grip and reinstated into fellowship with the holy, nor could they partake again in spiritual life. It is for this reason that Christ assumed the burden of the disobedient and endured suffering in the stead of sinners. The compassion, agony, and demise of the Son of God all emphasize the heinous magnitude of sin, affirming that liberation from its clutches, the aspiration for a higher existence, is attainable only through submission to Christ.
The unrepentant often justify themselves by pointing to those who profess faith, lamenting, I am as virtuous as they are. Their lives exhibit no greater self-denial, sobriety, or discretion than mine. They, too, revel in pleasure and self-gratification as much as I do. In doing so, they utilize the shortcomings of others as a shield for their own dereliction of duty. However, the transgressions and flaws of others do not vindicate anyone, for the Almighty has not set before us a fallible human model. Instead, the unblemished Son of God is provided as our exemplar, and those who criticize the conduct of avowed believers are themselves called to demonstrate superior lives and more illustrious examples. If their perception of what constitutes a true Christian is so elevated, does not their own iniquity become all the more grievous? They comprehend what is righteous, yet willfully choose to abstain from it.

Be wary of procrastination. Do not delay the crucial task of abandoning your sins and seeking a pure heart through Jesus. This is where innumerable souls have faltered, leading to their everlasting regret. I will not expound here on the brevity and uncertainty of life; rather, I wish to highlight the grave peril—a risk not fully appreciated—in postponing obedience to the tender entreaties of God’s Holy Spirit, in opting to persist in sin; for that is the essence of such procrastination. Sin, regardless of how minor it might seem, can only be indulged at the risk of immeasurable loss. That which we fail to conquer will assuredly conquer us and culminate in our ruin.

Adam and Eve convinced themselves that a transgression as seemingly minor as consuming the forbidden fruit could not unleash the dire consequences God had forewarned. Yet, this seemingly insignificant act was a violation of God’s immutable and sacred law, severing humanity from the Divine and unleashing a deluge of death and boundless sorrow upon our world. Generation after generation, our earth has emitted a ceaseless wail of grief, and the entire creation writhes in agony, all stemming from humankind’s disobedience. Even the heavens have been impacted by this rebellion against God. The cross of Calvary stands as a testament to the extraordinary sacrifice necessitated to atone for the infringement of the divine command. Let us not trivialize sin in any measure.
Every instance of defiance, each disregard or spurning of Christ's grace, reverberates back upon oneself; it solidifies the heart, corrupts the will, dulls the intellect, and progressively renders one not only less disposed to comply, but also less capable of heeding the gentle entreaties of God’s Holy Spirit.

Numerous individuals console a perturbed conscience with the notion that they can renounce their sinful path at will; they believe they can frivolously engage with mercy's overtures, yet be receptive to them again. They imagine that even after scorning the Spirit of grace, after aligning their influence with Satan, they can, in a dire moment, alter their trajectory. However, altering such a deeply ingrained pattern is not so simple. The experiences and teachings of a lifetime have so intricately shaped one's character that few then yearn to embrace the likeness of Jesus.

Even a single errant character trait, one sinfully nurtured desire, if obstinately fostered, will ultimately nullify the gospel's efficacy. Every act of sinful gratification intensifies the soul’s repulsion towards God. The individual who exhibits defiant unbelief or impassive disregard for divine truths merely harvests what they have sown. Among all the admonitions in the Bible, none is more dire against trifling with evil than the wise man’s assertion that the sinner shall be holden with the cords of his sins. Proverbs 5:22.

Christ stands ready to liberate us from sin, yet He does not coerce our will. If through continuous transgression our will becomes irrevocably bent on evil, and we lack the desire for liberation, if we reject His grace, what more can He do? Our own determined dismissal of His love leads to our undoing. Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation. Today if ye will hear His voice, harden not your hearts. 2 Corinthians 6:2; Hebrews 3:7, 8. Man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart—the human heart, a reservoir of conflicting joys and sorrows, a shelter for so much impurity and duplicity. He discerns its motivations, its deepest intentions. Approach Him with your heart, as blemished as it is. Emulate the psalmist, lay open its innermost chambers to the omnipresent gaze, crying out, Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting. Psalm 139:23, 24.
Many embrace a form of faith that is purely intellectual, a semblance of devoutness, while their hearts remain untouched by true cleansing. Let your invocation be, Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me. Psalm 51:10. Engage in sincere introspection with your soul. Exhibit the same fervor and tenacity as you would if your very earthly existence hung in the balance. This issue is one to be resolved between the Divine and your soul, a resolution with eternal ramifications. A mere semblance of hope will lead to your downfall.

Immerse yourself in the study of God’s word with a prayerful heart. That sacred text lays before you, in the divine law and the life of Christ, the foundational tenets of sanctity, without which no man shall see the Lord. Hebrews 12:14. It illuminates sin; it lucidly delineates the path to salvation. Attend to it as the very utterance of God speaking to your essence.

As you confront the grave nature of sin, as you witness your true self, do not succumb to despair. It was precisely sinners whom Christ sought to redeem. Our task is not to conciliate God towards us, but—behold the astounding grace!—God in Christ is reconciling the world unto Himself. 2 Corinthians 5:19. He tenderly beckons the hearts of His wayward children with His gentle love. No terrestrial parent could exhibit the patience God shows towards those He yearns to save. None could appeal more fervently to the sinner. The pleas from His lips surpass any human entreaty, every utterance a breath of ineffable love.

When Satan endeavors to remind you of your grave transgressions, lift your gaze to your Savior and speak of His virtues. Your solace lies in beholding His light. Acknowledge your sin, but declare to the adversary that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners and that through His unparalleled love, you too can be redeemed. 1 Timothy 1:15. Jesus posed a question to Simon concerning two debtors: one owed a modest amount, the other a substantial sum, yet both debts were absolved. He inquired of Simon which debtor would harbor greater love for the lender. Simon responded, He to whom he forgave most. Luke 7:43. We have sinned greatly, but Christ perished that we might find pardon. The value of His atonement suffices to advocate for us before the Father. Those most forgiven will exhibit the deepest love for Him, standing closest to His throne to extol His immense love and boundless sacrifice. It is in fully grasping God’s love that we truly comprehend the heinousness of sin. When we discern the length of the chain lowered for us, when we partly fathom the enormous sacrifice made on our behalf, our hearts are rendered tender and contrite.
