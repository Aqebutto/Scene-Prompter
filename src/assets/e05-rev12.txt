This portion of the chapter can be elucidated with minimal effort, as it mainly involves defining the symbols introduced. A brief explanation of each is as follows:
A "woman" represents a true church (2 Corinthians 11:2). When portrayed as corrupt, the woman symbolizes an apostate or corrupt church (Ezekiel 23:2-4; Revelation 17:3-6, 15, 18). Consequently, a pure woman, as depicted here, signifies the true church. "The sun" alludes to the splendor and radiance of the gospel era, while "the moon" symbolizes the Mosaic period. They had the type and shadow, while we have the antitype and substance. "A crown of twelve stars" aptly represents the twelve apostles. "A great red dragon" embodies pagan Rome (see commentary on verses 4 and 5). "Heaven" refers to the setting in which this representation was observed by the apostle. The events transpiring on Earth should not be mistaken for occurrences in heaven, where God resides. The vision that unfolded before the prophet's eyes seemed to take place in the celestial sphere, among the sun, moon, and stars.
Verses 1 and 2 span a period commencing shortly before the Christian Era, during which the church eagerly awaited the advent of the Messiah, and extending to the full establishment of the gospel church with its twelve apostles (Luke 2:25, 26, 38).
No symbols could be more apt and striking than those employed here. The Mosaic period, illuminated by light borrowed from the Christian Era, is fittingly represented by the moon, while the latter is symbolized by the sun. The church had the moon beneath her feet, indicating that the Mosaic period had just concluded, and she was adorned with the light of the gospel sun, which had recently risen. The church, anticipating its full organization with twelve apostles, is portrayed as such even before the man-child, Christ, enters the scene. Christ would become more closely associated with this church than the one from the previous era. The passage leaves no room for misinterpretation; thus, this representation does not disrupt a coherent system of interpretation.
"The Third Part of the Stars of Heaven." The dragon drew a third of the stars of heaven. If the twelve stars with which the woman is crowned, symbolically representing the twelve apostles, then the stars cast down by the dragon before his attempt to destroy the man-child, or before the Christian Era, might symbolize a portion of the rulers of the Jewish people. As we have previously seen in Revelation 8:12, the sun, moon, and stars are sometimes used symbolically in this sense. Judea became a Roman province sixty-three years before the birth of the Messiah. The Jews had three classes of rulers: kings, priests, and the Sanhedrin. The Roman power removed a third of these, the kings. Philip Smith, describing the siege of Jerusalem by the Romans and Herod and its capitulation in the spring of 37 BC after a stubborn resistance of six months, states: "Such was the end of the Asmonean dynasty, exactly 130 years after the first victories of Judas Maccabaeus, and in the seventieth year from the assumption of the diadem by Aristobulus I."
This reference to the stars undoubtedly possesses a broader meaning, connected to the truths emphasized in verses 7-9 of this chapter. As a consequence of the conflict revealed therein, it is apparent that a third of the angelic host, who sided with Satan in his rebellion against the Ruler of the universe, were expelled from the courts of glory.
"The Dragon Stood Before the Woman." It is now necessary to identify the power symbolized by the dragon, which can be accomplished with ease. The testimony regarding the "man-child" whom the dragon seeks to destroy applies solely to one being that has appeared in this world: our Lord Jesus Christ. No other has been caught up to God and His throne, but He has been thus exalted (Ephesians 1:20, 21; Hebrews 8:1, Revelation 3:21). No other has received from God the commission to rule all nations with a rod of iron, but He has been appointed to this work (Psalm 2:7-9).
There can be no doubt that the man-child represents Jesus Christ. The time to which the prophecy refers is equally clear. It was the time when Christ appeared in this world as an infant in Bethlehem.
Now, it is simple to identify the power symbolized by the dragon, for the dragon represents a power that attempted to destroy Christ at His birth. Was such an attempt made? Who made it? Those who have read how Herod, in a diabolical effort to destroy the infant Jesus, ordered the slaughter of all children in Bethlehem aged two years and under, need no formal answer to this question. But who was Herod? He was a Roman governor, deriving his power from Rome. At that time, Rome ruled over the entire world (Luke 2:1) and was thus the responsible actor in this event. Moreover, Rome was the only earthly government that could be symbolized in prophecy at that time, precisely because its dominion was universal. Consequently, the Roman Empire is widely considered by Protestant commentators to be the power indicated by the great red dragon.
It may be worth noting that during the second, third, fourth, and fifth centuries of the Christian Era, the dragon, next to the eagle, was the principal standard of the Roman legions. This red dragon was painted as if to faithfully mirror the image portrayed by the seer of Patmos, proclaiming to the world, "We are the nation which that picture represents."
As we have seen, Rome attempted to destroy Jesus Christ through Herod's sinister plot. The child born to the expectant and vigilant church was our beloved Redeemer, who is soon to rule the nations with a rod of iron. Herod could not destroy Him. The combined powers of earth and hell could not vanquish Him. Though temporarily held under the dominion of the grave, He shattered its cruel bonds, opened a path of life for humanity, and was caught up to God and His throne. He ascended to heaven in the sight of His disciples, bequeathing to them and us the promise of His return.
The church fled into the wilderness at the time when the papacy was firmly established in 538, where it was nourished by the word of God and the ministration of angels during the long, dark, and bloody rule of that power for 1260 years.
The War in Heaven, as depicted in the first six verses of this chapter, takes us to the culmination of the 1260 years in 1798, marking the end of papal supremacy. In the 7th verse, it is abundantly clear that we are transported back into earlier times. How far back? To the days of the first advent, when the malevolent Satan, working through pagan Rome, sought to annihilate the Savior of humanity; and even further back to the very genesis of the monumental conflict between truth and righteousness, when Michael (Christ) and His angels waged war against the dragon (Satan) and his angels. To confirm that Michael is indeed Christ, refer to Jude 9, 1 Thessalonians 4: 16, and John 5: 28, 29.
"Prevailed Not." We are grateful that in that primordial struggle, the archdeceiver was vanquished. As "Lucifer, son of the morning," he harbored envy and hatred in his heart, audaciously leading a legion of disenchanted angels in rebellion against God's dominion. However, Scripture asserts that he "prevailed not" and "was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him."
Centuries later, during Christ's first advent, "the great dragon," also known as "that old serpent called the devil, and Satan," made a supreme effort in the form of the great red dragon, embodying pagan Rome, to obliterate the world's Redeemer. Satan anticipated Christ's earthly mission as his final opportunity for success in dismantling the plan of salvation. He approached Christ with insidious temptations, hoping to conquer Him. Throughout Christ's ministry, Satan endeavored to destroy Him in various ways. Upon succeeding in entombing Him, Satan sought to hold Him there with malevolent triumph. Yet, in every confrontation, the Son of God emerged victorious, and He extends His gracious promise to His loyal followers: "To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with My Father in His throne" (Revelation 3: 21). This demonstrates that Jesus, while on Earth, engaged in a battle and achieved victory. Satan witnessed his last effort falter, his last scheme unravel. He had boasted that he would overcome the Son of God in His earthly mission, thereby rendering the plan of salvation a humiliating failure. He knew full well that if his final desperate attempt to thwart God's work failed, his last hope would wither, and all would be lost. In the words of verse 8, he "prevailed not," and thus the song is justly sung, "Therefore rejoice, you heavens, and you that dwell in them."
Their Place Found No More in Heaven. Satan and the fallen angels had suffered a dreadful defeat, which Christ describes by saying, "I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven" (Luke 10: 18), and Peter informs us that these fallen angels have been delivered "into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment" (2 Peter 2: 4).
The hope that he had long nurtured of defeating the Son of Man when He assumed our nature was forever extinguished. Satan's power was curtailed. He could no longer aspire to a personal encounter with the Son of God, for Christ had vanquished him. From then on, the church (the woman) became the target of his malice, and he employed all manner of nefarious methods against her, characteristic of his unbridled rage.
A song then resounds in heaven, "Now is come salvation." How can this be if these scenes are 
in the past? Had salvation and strength, the kingdom of God, and the power of His Christ truly arrived? Not in the least; but this song was sung with a prospective outlook. Those events were assured. Christ had won the great victory that permanently resolved the matter of their establishment.
The prophet subsequently casts a swift glance over Satan's actions from that moment until the end (verses 11, 12), during which the faithful "brethren" overcome him by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony, while his wrath intensifies as his time dwindles.
It was Satan who influenced Herod to attempt the execution of the Savior. Yet, the principal agent of the archrebel in waging war against Christ and His people throughout the early centuries of the Christian Era was the Roman Empire, in which paganism reigned supreme. Consequently, while the dragon primarily symbolizes Satan, it also represents pagan Rome in a secondary sense.
Here, we are once again transported back to the moment when Satan became fully cognizant of his failure in all attempts against the Lord of glory during His earthly mission. Recognizing this, he turned with unbridled fury, as previously noted, upon the church that Christ had established. We are then presented with another perspective of the church entering a condition described as being "in the wilderness." This phrase signifies a state of concealment from public view and protection from enemies. The church that, throughout the Dark Ages, loudly proclaimed her authoritative commands to an attentive Christendom and displayed her ostentatious banners to awestruck crowds, was not the church of Christ; it was the embodiment of the mystery of iniquity.
The "mystery of godliness" manifested as God appearing as a man; the "mystery of iniquity" was a man feigning to be God. This was the grand apostasy resulting from the fusion of paganism and Christianity. The genuine church remained hidden. In secluded places, they worshiped God. The caverns and concealed valleys of the Piedmont serve as emblematic locations where the truth of the gospel was fervently guarded against the fury of its adversaries. Here, God safeguarded His church, providing protection and nourishment through His divine providence.
The eagles' wings bestowed upon her aptly represent the urgency with which the true church had to pursue safety when the man of sin assumed power. God granted her assistance for this purpose. A similar figure is employed to portray God's interactions with ancient Israel. He declared to them through Moses, "Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto Myself." Exodus 19:4.
The mention of the period during which the woman is sustained in the wilderness as "a time and times and half a time," echoing the phrasing employed in Daniel 7:25, offers a clue for interpreting the latter passage. The same period is referred to in Revelation 12:6 as "a thousand two hundred and threescore days." This elucidates that a "time" corresponds to one year or 360 days; two "times," two years or 720 days; and "half a time," half a year or 180 days, cumulatively totaling 1,260 days. These symbolic days signify 1,260 literal years.
The serpent expelled water from his mouth like a flood to sweep away the church. Through its false doctrines, the papacy had so thoroughly corrupted all nations that it maintained unmitigated control over civil power for numerous centuries. Satan, utilizing this power, could unleash a formidable flood of persecution against the church from all sides, which he promptly did. (Refer to the commentary on the terrible persecution of the church in Daniel 7:25.) Millions of devout believers were swept away by the flood, but the church was not entirely consumed, as the days were shortened for the sake of the elect (Matthew 24:22).
"The earth aided the woman" by opening its mouth and engulfing the deluge. The sixteenth-century Protestant Reformation commenced its mission. God raised Martin Luther and his fellow workers to unveil the true nature of the papacy and shatter the grip with which superstition had bound the minds of the populace. Luther affixed his theses to the door of the Wittenburg church, and the pen with which he wrote them, as portrayed in the symbolic dream of the virtuous elector Frederick of Saxony, indeed spanned the continent and jolted the triple crown upon the pope's head. Royalty began to support the cause of the Reformers. This marked the advent of religious enlightenment and freedom, which God would not permit the darkness to extinguish.
The enchantment dissipated. People discovered that the papal bulls and anathemas fell harmlessly at their feet as soon as they dared to exercise their divine right to govern their consciences by His word alone. Defenders of the true faith multiplied. In time, there was sufficient Protestant territory in Europe and the New World to absorb the torrent of papal wrath, depriving it of its ability to harm the church. Thus, the earth aided the woman and has continued to do so to this day, as the spirit of the Reformation and religious liberty has been nurtured by the foremost nations of Christendom.
Battle against the Remnant. The dragon's endeavors, however, have not yet concluded. Verse 17 reveals another, final eruption of his fury, this time directed towards the last generation of Christians on earth. We assert that it is the last generation, for the dragon's war is waged against the remnant of the woman's offspring—the true church—and only the final generation can be accurately depicted as the remnant. If the belief that we have already arrived at the generation destined to witness the conclusion of earthly events is accurate, this battle against the truth must be imminent.
This remnant is distinguished by its observance of God's commandments and possession of Jesus Christ's testimony. This implies a Sabbath reform to be accomplished in the final days, as the Sabbath is the sole commandment concerning which there exists a disparity of belief and practice among those who recognize the decalogue as the moral law. This is further elaborated upon in the message of Revelation 14:9-12.
