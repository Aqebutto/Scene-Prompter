"He who cloaks his misdeeds shall find no prosperity: yet whosoever confesses and renounces them shall be granted mercy." Proverbs 28:13. The prerequisites for obtaining divine mercy are straightforward, equitable, and logical. Our Lord seeks not burdensome acts from us to grant the absolution of sin. It is not necessary to embark on exhausting pilgrimages or endure excruciating penitences to present our spirit to the celestial Lord or to atone for our lapses; rather, he who admits and abandons his sin shall receive mercy. The apostle pronounces, “Unveil your faults to each other, and intercede for each other, so that healing may occur.” James 5:16. Disclose your sins to God, who possesses the sole authority to pardon them, and your flaws to each other. If you have caused upset to a friend or neighbor, it is incumbent upon you to confess your error, and it is his responsibility to forgive you wholeheartedly. Then, you must seek God's forgiveness since the brethren you've aggrieved belong to God, and in causing him harm, you've rebelled against his Creator and Redeemer. This matter is brought forth to the sole authentic Mediator, our eminent High Priest, who "underwent all forms of temptation as we do, yet remained sinless," and who "experiences our weakness" and possesses the capacity to cleanse every trace of iniquity. Hebrews 4:15. Those who have yet to humble their souls before God in acknowledging their guilt have not met the initial condition for acceptance.

If we have not traversed the path of such repentance that is irrevocable and have not, with sincere humility of heart and fragmentation of spirit, conceded our transgressions, repudiating our iniquities, we have not truly implored for the absolution of sins, and if we have not sought, we have not uncovered the tranquility of God. The solitary rationale for our lack of forgiveness of past offenses is our reluctance for self-abasement and our resistance to conform to the stipulations prescribed within the scripture of truth. Pertinent guidance is provided on this subject. The admission of guilt, irrespective of being public or private, ought to stem from the core of the heart and be candidly communicated. It should not be cajoled by the culprit. It shouldn't be articulated in a cavalier or nonchalant manner nor coerced by those devoid of a profound cognizance of the detestable nature of sin. The confession radiating from the deepest recesses of one's soul reaches the deity of boundless compassion. The psalmist proclaims, “The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.” Psalm 34:18. Authentic admission is invariably precise, recognizing distinct sins. They might be such that they are presented solely to God; they could be transgressions that should be admitted to those they have harmed through their commission, or they might be of a communal nature, necessitating public admission. However, all confessions ought to be explicit and direct, recognizing the exact sins for which one bears guilt.

In the epoch of Samuel, the Israelites meandered away from the divine Presence. They bore the affliction arising from their transgressions, for they had relinquished their faith in the Almighty, lost their discernment of His power and wisdom to govern the nation, and forfeited their confidence in His capacity to shield and validate His cause. They deviated from the Supernal Arbiter of the cosmos and wished to be ruled akin to the adjoining nations. Only upon uttering this categorical confession did they discover tranquility, “We have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.” - 1 Samuel 12:19. The precise trespass of which they were cognizant had to be acknowledged. Their ingratitude overwhelmed their spirits and estranged them from God. Admission will not be pleasing to the Lord absent of sincere penitence and reformation. Significant transformations in life are mandatory; all that is reprehensible to the Divine must be renounced. This will be the consequence of authentic remorse for sin. The task that lies before us is clearly delineated: “Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before Mine eyes; cease to do evil; learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.” - Isaiah 1:16, 17. “If the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.” - Ezekiel 33:15. Paul expresses, when referring to the process of penance, “Ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge!"

"In all dealings, you have demonstrated clarity regarding this matter.” 2 Corinthians 7:11. When transgressions have numbed moral sensitivities, the offender fails to recognize the blemishes in his character or comprehend the magnitude of his wrongdoings. Unless he surrenders to the convicting influence of the Holy Spirit, he persists in a state of partial oblivion to his sinfulness. His admissions lack genuine remorse and commitment. With every confession of his erring ways, he offers a rationale to vindicate his actions, asserting that extenuating circumstances led to the misdeeds for which he is censured. Upon consuming the forbidden fruit, a profound sense of guilt and dread flooded Adam and Eve. Their initial response was to contemplate excuses for their sin and elude the feared decree of death. When the Lord inquired about their transgression, Adam shifted the blame partially to God and his partner: “The woman whom Thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.” The woman deflected the fault onto the serpent, declaring, “The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.” Genesis 3:12, 13. By posing implied queries in her defense, she indirectly held God accountable for their demise. This tendency for self-defense emanated from the father of untruth and has been perpetuated by every son and daughter of Adam.

Revelations of such magnitude are not divinely inspired, nor shall they find favor with the Lord. Genuine repentance propels a man to shoulder his own sin, acknowledging it devoid of duplicity or pretense. Mirroring the humble tax collector, without daring to raise his gaze to the heavens, he will beseech, “God be merciful to me, a sinner,” and those who concede their transgressions shall be exonerated, for the Messiah will advocate His sacrifice on behalf of the contrite spirit. The testament of sincere contrition and humility demonstrated in the divine Scripture unveils a spirit of confession void of justification for sin or attempts at self-vindication. Paul refrained from self-defense; he portrayed his sin in its severest light, not daring to diminish his guilt. His admission, “Many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them. And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities.” Acts 26:10, 11. He did not shy away from confessing that “Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.” 1 Timothy 1:15. The contrite and humble heart, softened by authentic repentance, will perceive a semblance of God’s love and Calvary’s price; and just as a son divulges to his doting father, so will the sincerely remorseful lay bare all his transgressions before the Lord.

As inscribed in sacred scripture, “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”1 John 1:9. The divine proclamation avows, “Ye shall seek Me, and find Me, when ye shall search for Me with all your heart.”Jeremiah 29:13. To be fully transformed into His divine likeness, we must entrust our whole heart to God. Our inherent nature induces separation from the Divine. Our spiritual predicament is encapsulated through words such as, “Dead in trespasses and sins,” “the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint;” “no soundness in it.” We are ensnared by the deceptive webs of Satan, “taken captive by him at his will.”Ephesians 2:1; Isaiah 1:5, 6;2 Timothy 2:26. God yearns to mend our afflictions and to liberate us from these chains. Yet, given the necessity of a holistic renewal, ultimately to a transformation of our complete nature, we must devote ourselves entirely to His divine sovereignty.

The combat against one's own self stands as the most significant clash that has ever been waged. The capitulation of self, yielding wholeheartedly to the divine will of God, engages us in a struggle; however, the soul must acquiesce to God before it can be restored in sanctity. The governance of God is not as the devil might portray it, grounded in blind obedience or unthinking authority, rather it appeals to the intellect and the moral compass. "Come now, and let us reason together" resonates as God's invitation to the beings He has brought to life. Isaiah 1:18. God refrains from imposing his will on his creations, unable to acknowledge devotion that is not earnestly and knowingly offered. A mere imposed compliance would hinder all genuine growth of intellect or character, transforming man into nothing more than a mechanical being. This is not the intention of the Creator. He aspires for man, being the pinnacle of His creative prowess, to attain the utmost possible development. He presents the pinnacle of blessings He yearns to bestow upon us through His grace. He beckons us to surrender ourselves to Him so He can guide us according to His will. It is up to us to decide whether we will be liberated from the fetters of sin, to partake in the resplendent liberty of God's children. In devoting ourselves to God, we must inevitably relinquish all that would create a chasm between us and Him. Thus, the Saviour proclaims, "Whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be My disciple." Luke

14:33. Whatever might allure the heart away from the divine ought to be renounced. Mammon captivates many as an idol. The magnetism of money, the yearning for affluence, is the illustrious manacle that binds them to Satan. Esteem and terrestrial honor are the subjects of reverence for another category. A life of egotistical comfort and exemption from accountability is the idol for some. Nonetheless, these servile shackles must be shattered. We cannot be partially the Lord’s possession and marginally the world's. We are not the progeny of God unless we wholly belong to Him. A fraction serves God ostensibly whilst depending on personal exertions to abide by His rules, mold a virtuous character, and secure redemption. Their hearts are not stirred by a profound sense of Christ's love. Instead, they attempt to fulfill Christian duties as obligatory tasks for the attainment of heaven. Such faith holds no value. When Christ resides in the heart, the soul becomes imbued with His affection, with the delight of fellowship with Him, such that it adheres to Him, and in the thought of Him, the self becomes lost. Love for Christ becomes the source of conduct. Those who sense the compelling love of God do not question the minimum they can offer to meet God's stipulations; they do not lobby for the least stringent criterion but aim for utter accordance with the desires of their Redeemer. With fervent longing, they surrender all and display a commitment as valuable as the goal they pursue.

A declaration of faith in Christ, absent of profound affection, is mere idle chatter, insubstantial ritual, and cumbersome toil. Do you perceive that surrendering everything to Christ is an excessive forfeit? Contemplate the question, “What has Christ bestowed for my sake?” The divine Son relinquished all—existence, affection, and affliction—for our salvation. Is it conceivable that we, the undeserving beneficiaries of such immense love, would deny Him our hearts? Throughout our existence, we have partaken in the blessings of His mercy, and it is henceforth that we cannot entirely comprehend the depth of the oblivion and desolation from which we have been redeemed. Can we gaze upon Him, marred by our trespasses, and still be inclined to discount His boundless love and sacrifice? In light of the inconceivable degradation of the magnificent Sovereign, shall we chafe because the path to life necessitates upheaval and self-effacement? The interrogation of many an arrogant soul is, “Why must I traverse penitence and abasement before receiving the certainty of my acceptance by God?” I guide you to Christ. He was devoid of sin. Moreover, He reigned as the celestial Prince; yet, in humanity's stead, He shouldered the sins of all. “He was numbered with the transgressors; and He bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.” Isaiah 53:12. Yet what do we renounce when we cede all? An immersed-in-sin heart, for Jesus to sanctify, to cleanse by His own lifeblood, and to rescue by His unparalleled love.


Nevertheless, individuals consider it a hardship to relinquish everything! I blush to hear this statement uttered, blush to pen it. The Divine does not command us to forsake amenities that would be of ultimate benefit for us to keep. In all his acts, He contemplates the welfare of His offspring. If only those who have not accepted Christ understood that he has infinitely loftier gifts to present than what they procure for themselves. Man inflicts the harshest detriment and unfairness on his own soul when his thoughts and actions contradict the Divine's intention. True delight cannot be discovered along the path barred by Him who knows what is supremely good and orchestrates His creatures' well-being. The trajectory of transgression is one of sorrow and ruin. It is erroneous to suppose God delights in witnessing His children undergo suffering. All celestial realms are invested in mankind's joy. Our celestial Parent does not seal the passages of merriment to any of His offspring. 

Divine directives urge us to forgo the excesses that inflict agony and regret that shut us out from the portals of delight and paradise. The Savior of humanity accepts men as they are, replete with their needs, flaws, and feebleness. Not only does He purge sin and extend redemption through His blood, but He also pacifies the profound yearnings of all those who agree to don His yoke to carry His load.

The Divine Intention is to bestow tranquility and respite upon all who seek Him for their spiritual nourishment. He mandates only those responsibilities that guide our pathway towards realms of euphoria that the deviant can never access. The authentic, jubilant existence of the soul lies in the formation of Christ within, acting as the beacon of hope. Many are questioning, "How am I to make the surrender of myself to God?" You have the aspiration to devote yourself to Him, yet you are menially potent in moral strength, enslaved by skepticism, and influenced by the habits of your sinful existence. Your promises and decisions are likened to unstable sand dunes. You lack the power to govern your thoughts, your impulses, and your affections. The recognition of your fractured vows and forfeited promises deteriorates your trust in your own honesty, leading you to believe that you're unworthy of His acceptance, but despair is needless. What you ought to comprehend is the true potency of the will. This is the ruling force in human nature, the power of decision-making or of choice. Everything rests on the correct exercise of the will. The authority to choose is a gift God has bestowed upon humanity; it is their prerogative to utilize. You cannot alter your heart, you cannot independently dedicate its affections to God, but you can decide to serve Him. You can proffer Him your will; He will then execute within you the will and act according to His noble pleasure. Thus, your entire being will be placed under the reign of Christ's Spirit; your affections will be focused on Him, and your thoughts will align with His.

Aspirations for virtue and sanctification are commendable in their scope, yet confined to such aspirations, they yield no fruit. Numerous souls find themselves adrift, harboring the hope and desire to embrace the mantle of Christianity. Yet they falter at the pivotal juncture of surrendering their will to the Divine. Therein, they defer the active decision to be followers of Christ. With the proper application of willpower, an absolute transformation can transpire within your existence. Aligning your will with Christ draws you into an alliance with a force transcending all dominions and authority. You will be imbued with a divine fortitude to keep you unyielding and thus, through perpetual submission to God, you become equipped to embody the New Life, that is, the life of faith.
