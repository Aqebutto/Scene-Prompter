A marvel of prophetic scripture is its foresight and provision; it never leads the chosen into trials and tribulations only to abandon them in the throes of difficulty. When prophecy ushers God's people into scenes fraught with peril, it does not desert them to conjecture their fate, to wallow in uncertainty, and perhaps despair concerning the final outcome. Instead, prophecy accompanies them through the ordeal, guiding them to the end, disclosing the ultimate triumph of the steadfast.
The initial five verses of Revelation 14 exemplify this promise. Chapter thirteen concluded with a portrayal of God's people—seemingly weak, outnumbered, devoid of defences—engaged in a mortal struggle against the most potent earthly powers that the dragon can rally to its aid. A decree is enforced, supported by the land's highest authority, insisting that they must worship the image and accept the mark, or face execution for non-compliance. In such a conflict, under such duress, what can God's people do? What will their fate be? Advancing with the apostle to the next episode of the unfolding narrative, what spectacle greets us? The very same congregation is found on Mount Zion alongside the Lamb, a triumphant cohort, strumming heavenly harps in the celestial court. Thus, we receive the assurance that when our confrontation with the forces of darkness looms, deliverance for God's people is not merely a possibility but an impending certainty.
The 144,000 seen standing on Mount Zion are believed to be the saints depicted in Revelation 13, the targets of the beast's and his image's wrath. They correspond with the ones sealed in Revelation 7, already identified as the living righteous at the Second Coming of Christ. These are the ones 'redeemed from among men' (verse 4), a phrase applicable solely to those translated from the realm of the living. Paul aspired to attain resurrection from among the dead (Philippians 3: 11). This aspiration defines the hope of those in Jesus—a resurrection from the dead. Redemption from among men, from the living, implies a separate concept, translating to only one thing—translation. Thus, the 144,000 are living saints to be translated at Christ's Second Coming.
John perceives this congregation standing on Mount Zion, undoubtedly the heavenly Mount Zion, for the harpers' song is heard emanating from heaven. This is the same Zion from which the Lord proclaims His words, intimately connected with the arrival of the Son of man (Joel 3: 16, Hebrews 12: 25-28; Revelation 16: 17). Acknowledging the existence of a Mount Zion and Jerusalem in the heavenly realm could serve as a potent countermeasure against the misleading doctrines of a second chance and an earthly millennium of peace.
A few more specific details about the 144,000 warrant our attention in addition to those provided in Revelation 7. The name of the Lamb's Father is inscribed in their foreheads. They are said to bear the seal of God in Revelation 7. This provides a vital clue to understanding God's seal, as it becomes evident that the Father considers His name to be His seal. The law's commandment containing God's name is thus the law's seal. The Sabbath commandment is the only one encapsulating the title that sets the true God apart from all false deities. Therefore, anyone who genuinely observes this commandment carries the seal of the living God.
The 144,000 sing a unique song that no other group can learn. In Revelation 15: 3, it's dubbed the song of Moses and the Lamb. Moses' song, observable in Exodus 15, is a ballad of experience and deliverance. Hence, the song of the 144,000 is a hymn of their redemption. None others can participate in this melody, for no other congregation will share the same unique experiences as theirs.
The 144,000 'were not defiled with women.' In the realm of biblical symbolism, a woman is emblematic of a church, with a virtuous woman representing a pure church, and a fallen woman signifying an apostate one. Hence, a defining characteristic of this sacred assembly is their state of purity at the time of their deliverance; they are untouched by the defilements of the degenerate churches of their time, maintaining no affiliation with them. This is not to imply, however, that they have never been connected to such churches. In fact, it is only at specific junctures that individuals become tainted by these fallen entities. In Revelation 18:4, a divine call resonates, summoning God's people, still ensnared in Babylon, to emancipate themselves lest they become accomplices in her sins. Heeding this call, they sever ties, thereby escaping the stains of her transgressions. The same applies to the 144,000 - although they may have once been linked with corrupt churches, they courageously sever such associations when they threaten their spiritual purity.
These individuals are described as following the Lamb wherever He may lead. It is believed that this refers to their state of redemption. In their glorified condition, they become the Lamb's cherished companions within the divine kingdom. 'The Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters,' it is said of the same congregation in Revelation 7:17.
These chosen ones are also called the 'first fruits unto God and to the Lamb.' This term is employed to highlight specific conditions or statuses. Christ Himself is considered the first fruits, embodying the true realization of the wavesheaf. The initial receivers of the gospel are referred to by James as a kind of first fruits (James 1:18). In the same vein, the 144,000, who are prepared on earth during the tumultuous final days, are transported to heaven without experiencing death and thus hold a preeminent position. As such, they are deemed the first fruits unto God and the Lamb. This portrayal of the victorious 144,000 brings to a conclusion the prophetic trajectory that began with Revelation 12.
The First Angel's Message appears in these verses as a new scenario and chain of prophetic events. Our knowledge of this emanates from the fact that the preceding sections delineate a group of the redeemed in a state of immortality, a sight that forms part of the prophetic sequence beginning with Revelation 12:1. No prophecy transcends this state of immortality. Thus, whenever we encounter the end of the world within a prophetic trajectory, we comprehend that this particular path culminates there and any subsequent revelations belong to a fresh series of events. The book of Revelation is intrinsically composed of these independent prophetic chains, as already demonstrated in numerous examples.
The declaration portrayed in these verses is the premier of the trio, commonly referred to as 'the three angels' messages of Revelation 14.' The prophecy itself warrants our designation of these as the first, second, and third. In the ensuing verses, the final one is explicitly termed 'the third angel,' allowing us to deduce that its predecessor is the second angel and the one preceding that, the first angel.
These angels are palpably symbolic, for their assigned task is to proclaim the everlasting gospel to the populace. However, the responsibility of gospel preaching has not been bequeathed to literal angels; instead, it falls upon men who are entrusted with this sacred duty. Therefore, each of these three angels symbolizes those individuals who are ordained to disseminate amongst their fellow men the unique truths forming the core of these messages.
Literal angels, deeply engrossed in the work of grace amongst men, serve those destined to inherit salvation. Given the structured nature of celestial undertakings, it is conceivable that a literal angel presides over and supervises the work associated with each message (Hebrews 1:14; Revelation 1:1; 22:16).
These symbols underscore the stark contrast that Scripture draws between terrestrial and celestial entities. Whenever earthly governments, even the most virtuous, are to be depicted, the most fitting symbol is invariably a wild beast. Conversely, to portray the work of God, a radiant, powerful angel is employed as the emblem.
The significance of the tasks delineated in Revelation 14:6-12 becomes evident to anyone who scrutinizes it attentively. These messages, by their very essence, must form the primary topic of interest for their epoch. This is not to suggest that the majority of the populace in that era will heed them; regrettably, the present truth of any given time is frequently disregarded. Yet, these messages constitute the focal point to which people will pay utmost attention if they are cognizant of their paramount interests.
When God assigns His ministers to announce that His judgment hour has arrived, that Babylon has fallen, and that anyone who worships the beast and his image shall endure His wrath poured out unmitigated into His cup of indignation—a threat graver than any other in Scripture—no individual can risk their soul by deeming these warnings unessential or ignoring them. This highlights the necessity in every era for concerted efforts to comprehend the Lord's work, lest we forfeit the benefits of present truth. This is particularly pertinent today when numerous signs herald the imminent arrival of earth's ultimate crisis.
This angel of Revelation 14:6 is termed 'another angel,' given John's earlier vision of a similar angel traversing heaven, as described in Revelation 8:13, declaring the last three of the seven trumpets as woe trumpets.
The Timing of the Message is our first point of interest. When can we anticipate the proclamation 'The hour of His judgment is come'? Given the possibility that it may occur in our own time, we need to scrutinize this query with grave attention. More definitive proof of this will become apparent as we delve deeper into the topic. The very possibility should ignite every heart, accelerating its pulse, inciting an acute awareness of the monumental significance of this epoch in which we dwell. In regard to the timing of this prophecy, there exist only three plausible positions. These encompass the assertion that this message was delivered in the past, such as during the apostolic or the Reformation era; that it is destined for proclamation in a future age; or, alternatively, that it pertains to the present generation.

We begin our inquiry by examining the past. The intrinsic nature of the messages themselves negates the prospect that they could have been proclaimed during the time of the apostles. It is clear that the apostles did not herald the advent of God's judgment hour. Had they done so, their proclamation would have been at odds with reality, casting a discrediting pall of falsehood over their preaching. They certainly had words to say about judgment, yet they indicated an indefinite future for its execution. According to Christ's own utterance, the final judgment of Sodom, Gomorrah, Tyre, Sidon, Chorazin, and Capernaum was situated in an undefined time yet to come from their present day. (Matthew 10: 15; 11: 21-24.)
Paul, addressing the superstitious Athenians, declared that God had appointed a day on which He would judge the world. (Acts 17: 31.) In his discourse with Felix, he spoke 'of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come.' Acts 24: 25. To the Romans, he elucidated a day when God would judge mankind's secrets through Christ. (Romans 2: 16.) He directed the Corinthians' gaze to a future moment when 'we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ.' 2 Corinthians 5: 10.
James encouraged the scattered brethren with the assurance that they were, in a time yet to come, to be judged by the law of liberty. (James 2: 1 2.) Both Peter and Jude referenced the inaugural rebel angels as being reserved for the judgment of the great day, a future event at that time, to which the ungodly of this world were also destined. (2 Peter 2: 4, 9; Jude 6.) All these declarations stand in stark contrast to the arresting pronouncement that 'the hour of His judgment is come!' - a resounding proclamation that must reverberate when the momentous message before us is broadcasted.
From the apostolic age onward, there has been no event that could plausibly be construed as the fulfilment of this initial message until we reach the Reformation in the sixteenth century. Some posit that Luther and his compatriots were the ones who disseminated the first message, and that the subsequent two messages have been conveyed since his era.
However, this contention is more appropriately resolved by reference to historical evidence than by abstract argument. Consequently, we seek concrete indications that the Reformers announced such a message. The teachings of the Reformers are comprehensively documented, their writings preserved. When and where did they stimulate the world with the declaration that the hour of God's judgment had arrived? There exists no record asserting that such a proclamation was the crux of their preaching.
Certain interpreters conjecture that the passage in Revelation 14: 6-11 pertains to the Reformation period and found fulfilment in the preaching of Luther and his fellow reformers who illuminated the doctrinal errors of the Romish Church. However, there seem to be insurmountable impediments to these interpretations. The first angel's evangelistic reach far exceeds that of the Reformers. They were so far from preaching to every inhabitant of the earth that their teachings did not even permeate all of Christian Europe.
The Reformation was barred entry into some of the most extensive kingdoms under Roman jurisdiction. It was entirely excluded from Spain, Portugal, and Italy. Nor could it be said, with any semblance of truth, during the time of the Reformation that 'the hour of God's judgment is come.' The hour of God's judgment is a period precisely demarcated in the chronological prophecies of Daniel and John.
Luther himself was quoted saying, 'I hope the last day of judgment is not far, I persuade myself verily it will not be absent full three hundred years longer; for God's word will decrease and be darkened for want of true shepherds and servants of God.' He looked forward, with both trepidation and anticipation, to the divine voice resounding, 'Behold the Bridegroom cometh.' Luther firmly believed that God neither would nor could endure the rampant wickedness of the world much longer. In his view, God must inevitably intervene with the dreadful day, punishing the world's contempt for His divine word.

Such historical documents should be considered conclusive regarding the role of the Reformers. Given the compelling arguments thus far precluding the attribution of the judgment message to the past, we now proceed to consider the perspective that locates this message in a future era, subsequent to the second advent. The rationale for such a postulation lies in the observation that John beheld the angel soaring through the heavens immediately after he saw the Lamb standing on Mount Zion with the 144,000, an event yet to come.
This line of reasoning might hold weight if the book of Revelation were a single, continuous prophecy. However, as it is constituted of a sequence of independent prophetic threads, and as we have previously demonstrated that one such thread concludes with the fifth verse of this chapter, only for a fresh strand to commence at the sixth verse, the aforementioned perspective is untenable.
In order to illustrate that the message cannot find its fulfillment in an era subsequent to the second advent, a few reasons will suffice. The apostolic mission extended only to the 'harvest,' the culmination of the world. (Matthew 13: 39.) Therefore, if this angel bearing 'the everlasting gospel' appears post this event, he preaches a divergent gospel, thereby invoking Paul's anathema outlined in Galatians 1: 8.
Naturally, the second message cannot precede the first. Yet, the second message heralds the fall of Babylon, after which a voice from heaven implores, 'Come out of her, My people.' The idea of situating this after the second advent of Christ seems nonsensical, given that all of God's people, the living and the dead, at that point are swept up to meet the Lord in the air, thereafter to remain eternally with Him. (1 Thessalonians 4: 17.) There can be no exodus from Babylon following this. Christ does not lead them to Babylon, but to the Father's house, a place of many mansions. (John 14: 2, 3.)
A brief survey of the third angel's message, which must be realized in a future age if the first one is, further illuminates the implausibility of this stance. This message cautions against the worship of the beast, a reference undoubtedly to the papal beast. However, this papal beast meets its destruction and is consigned to the burning flame upon Christ's return. (Daniel 7: 11; 2 Thessalonians 2: 8.) It is cast into the lake of fire at that juncture, no longer able to vex the saints of the Most High. (Revelation 19: 20.)
Why should we entangle ourselves in the incongruity of situating a message against the worship of the beast at a point in time when the beast no longer exists and its worship is an impossibility? In Revelation 14: 13, a blessing is bestowed upon those who henceforth die in the Lord, that is, from the moment the threefold message commences to be disseminated. This irrefutably establishes that the message must be delivered prior to the first resurrection, for post this event, all who partake in it are beyond the reach of death.
Hence, we dismiss this viewpoint concerning a future era as both unscriptural and impracticable. Now, we are adequately equipped to scrutinize the third perspective, which attributes the message to the present generation. The previous discussions regarding the two preceding points have greatly reinforced this proposition. If the message has not been delivered in the past, and cannot be disseminated in the future after Christ's return, the only plausible placement is within the current generation. Given that we are undeniably in the twilight days preceding Christ's Second Coming, where else could we place it? Indeed, the very essence of the message itself restricts it to the final generation of humanity. It declares that 'the hour of God's judgment has come.' The judgment signifies the end of the work of salvation for the world, and hence, the proclamation heralding its advent can be made only as we near the conclusion of earthly time.
Further, evidence that the message belongs to the current epoch emerges when it is proven that the angel of Revelation 10, who delivers his message to this generation, is the same entity as the first angel of Revelation 14.
Consequently, an analytical assessment of historical records, in conjunction with thoughtful and methodical interpretation of the relevant Biblical passages, leads us to a single, inevitable conclusion: the judgment message, a crucial aspect of the unfolding of end-time prophecies, must belong to the present generation. In the divine plan, it seems, our epoch has a significant role to play. This recognition imparts a profound sense of responsibility and urgency to our generation, a call to attentiveness and spiritual readiness as we approach the precipice of momentous celestial events.

The Apostle Paul, standing before the Roman governor Felix, reasoned about the 'judgment to come,' and to the Athenians on Mars Hill, he affirmed that God 'hath appointed a day in the which He will judge the world in righteousness by that Man whom He hath ordained.' Acts 17: 31.
The prophecy concerning the 2300 days, articulated in Daniel 8 and 9, unmistakably indicates this hour of judgment. This prophecy, the most prolonged chronology documented in Holy Writ, extends from 457 BC to AD 1844. It is at this juncture, as we have previously observed in our exploration of Daniel's prophecy, that the sanctuary was ordained to be purified. This purification, as indicated by the typology in Leviticus 16, signified the ultimate work of atonement.
The proceedings of this critical day, designated as the Day of Atonement, effectively act as an allegory for the day of judgment, as evinced by the following citations:
'The grand Day of Atonement, with its unique and compelling rites, fell on the tenth day of the seventh month... It was a day in which each individual was summoned to fast and chastise his soul; to solemnly and penitently contemplate his sinful paths and transgressions... The individual who failed to demonstrate due penitence faced the threat of death, a direct punitive response from the hand of Jehovah.' 
'It was on the tenth day of the seventh month that the actual Day of Atonement took place. The Jubilee also began on the same day, signalled by the sound of the grave trumpet; an emblem of God approaching in judgment.'
'On the New Year Day (Tishri 1) it was believed that divine decrees were recorded, and that on the Day of Atonement (Tishri 10) these decrees were sealed, thus the ten days are known as the 'Terrible Days' and the 'Ten Penitential Days.' The Day of Atonement was held in such awe that a Jewish book of ritual describes the angels as trembling in fear, exclaiming, 'Behold, the Day of Judgment has arrived!' '
''God, perched on His throne to judge the world...opens the Book of Records; it is read, every man's signature being found therein. The great trumpet is sounded; a still small voice is heard; the angels shudder, saying, 'This is the day of judgment.'...On New Year's Day the decree is written; on the Day of Atonement it is sealed who shall live and who shall die.'' 
The question that arises is whether a message of such weight has been imparted to the world. And again, Is such a message being heralded in the world at present? We are convinced that the momentous second advent movement of the past century aligns perfectly with the prophecy.
As early as 1831, William Miller of Low Hampton, New York, reached the conclusion that the Gospel era was nearing its conclusion through his earnest and comprehensive study of the prophecies. He anticipated that the culmination, coinciding with the end of the prophetic periods, would occur around the year 1843. This estimation was later extended to the autumn of 1844.
His approach to the prophecies was rigorous and systematic, as he adopted a robust rule of interpretation. This rule is a foundational prerequisite for every religious reformation and every significant progression in prophetic language. The rule insists on accepting the language of the Scriptures as literal, unless context or linguistic laws demand a figurative interpretation, and to allow scripture to interpret scripture. Although he did err on a crucial point, which will be explained later, in principle, and in numerous specific details, his understanding was correct. He was journeying on the right path, making significant progress beyond any theological framework of his time.
As Miller began to disseminate his ideas, they were widely embraced, sparking significant religious revivals in various regions. A plethora of co-laborers, individuals esteemed for their piety and influence in the religious sphere, flocked to his cause. Notable figures such as F. G. Brown, Charles Fitch, Josiah Litch, and J. V. Himes rallied around Miller's standard.
The period from 1840 to 1844 marked a time of fervent activity and considerable progress for this movement. A message was transmitted to the world, echoing the essential characteristics of the proclamation detailed in Revelation 14: 6, 7. It was, in essence, the gospel of the kingdom that Christ foretold would be disseminated throughout the world as a testimony to all nations, preceding the end times. (Matthew 24: 14.)
The execution of these scriptures entails the preaching of the imminent end. The gospel couldn't serve as a sign of the end, unless it was perceived as such, with the approaching end being one of its leading themes. The Advent Herald articulated the truth of this point in the following words:

'As an indication of the approach of the end, there was, however, to be seen 'another angel flying through the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people.' Revelation 14: 6. The burden of this angel was to be the same gospel which had been before proclaimed; but connected with it was the additional motive of the proximity of the kingdom 'saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come: and worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.' Verse 7. No mere preaching of the gospel, without announcing its proximity, could fulfill this message.'



The individuals who found themselves engrossed in this movement recognized it as a fulfillment of prophecy, asserting that they were disseminating the message embodied in Revelation 14: 6, 7. They declared:
'In the strictest and most literal sense, I implore you this evening, 'Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come.' We now find ourselves on the precipice of the final hour of the last day, as prophesied by the apostle. We linger on the brink of twilight of that day, at the last hour. The end is near, so very near, it stands at our threshold. My dear listeners, I plead with you to acknowledge its proximity, its presence at our doorstep, as affirmed by all who have diligently studied this matter and sought divine guidance... all voices converge to the conclusion... the reign of Christ is imminent.' 
Revelation 14 vividly depicts an angel soaring through the heavens, bearing the everlasting gospel to preach to the denizens of Earth and every nation, tribe, language, and people. When the event symbolized by this scene transpires, the day of the Lord's judgment is unequivocally upon us, for the angel calls out to humanity, 'Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment has come.' ' 
'It is incumbent upon us all to implore others to 'fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come.' Yet, this duty falls even more heavily upon the shoulders of God's ministers.' 
However, the pervasive movement heralding the second advent of Christ and the declaration that 'the hour of His judgment is come' was not limited to the West. It enveloped the world, adhering to the angel's proclamation 'to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people.' Mourant Brock, an Anglican clergyman and prominent leader in the advent movement in the British Isles, informs us:
'The expectation of the Redeemer's near return is not confined to Great Britain; the call to vigilance echoes in America, India, and across the European Continent... Even in Wurtemberg, a Christian community, numbering in the hundreds, anticipates the Second Advent. A Christian minister hailing from the Caspian Sea coastline informed me of the same daily expectation among his people, who refer to it as 'the day of consolation.' An American publication, 'The Millennium,' mentions about 300 ministers spreading 'the Gospel of the kingdom,' while approximately 700 from the Church of England are sounding the same alarm.' 
Dr. Joseph Wolff journeyed through Arabia, the land inhabited by the descendants of Hobab, Moses' brother-in-law. He recounts a book he encountered in Yemen:
'The local Arabs possess a book called 'Seera,' which explores the Second Coming of Christ and His reign in glory... In Yemen, I spent six days with the children of Rechabites. These people eschew wine, refrain from planting vineyards, sowing seeds, and live in tents, remembering the words of Jonadab the son of Rechab. Among them were children of Israel from the tribe of Dan, who resided near Yerim in Hatramawt [sic], sharing the Rechabites' anticipation for the Messiah's imminent arrival in the clouds of heaven.' 
D. T. Taylor eloquently articulates the widespread propagation of the advent hope:
'In Wurtemberg, a Christian colony of hundreds anticipates Christ's imminent return. Another group with similar beliefs resides on the Caspian's shores. The Molokaners, a considerable body of dissenters from the Russian Greek Church residing on the shores of the Baltic, known for their piety and adherence to the Holy Scriptures as their only creed, eagerly await Christ's immediate and visible reign upon earth. In Russia, the doctrine of Christ's coming and reign finds acceptance among many of the lower classes. It has stirred a great deal of discussion in Germany, especially in the southern region among the Moravians. In Norway, charts and literature concerning the advent have been disseminated widely, and many have accepted the doctrine. Among the Tartars in Tartary, there is a prevailing expectation of Christ's advent about this time. English and American writings on this doctrine have been distributed to Holland, Germany, India, Ireland, Constantinople, Rome, and nearly every missionary station worldwide...'

Dr. Joseph Wolff, as per his meticulous journals, carried the message of the imminent advent of the Lord between 1821 and 1845 across a remarkable diversity of geographical regions and cultural landscapes. His journey spanned Palestine, Egypt, the Red Sea's shores, Mesopotamia, Crimea, Persia, Georgia, the vast expanse of the Ottoman Empire, Greece, Arabia, Turkistan, Bokhara, Afghanistan, Cashmere, Hindustan, Thibet, Holland, Scotland, and Ireland. Notably, he also echoed the message in the great metropolises of Constantinople, Jerusalem, and New York City. He preached to a wide range of denominations, including Jews, Turks, Mohammedans, Parsees, Hindus, Chaldeans, Yeseedes, Syrians, and Sabeans, as well as esteemed figures such as pashas, sheiks, shahs, the king of Organtsh and Bokhara, and the queen of Greece. His extraordinary efforts led the Investigator to comment, 'No individual has, perhaps, given greater publicity to the doctrine of the Second Coming of the Lord Jesus Christ than this well-known missionary to the world. Wherever he goes, he proclaims the approaching advent of the Messiah in glory.'
A revered scholar deeply engaged in the advent movement further elucidates, 'Undeniably, the Lord's cautionary pronouncement was heeded, and indeed, at that specific juncture, the voice rang through the Church, prophesying the advent's proximity. It may be confidently asserted that a flood of tracts and works forecasting the advent and its nearness, exceeded any volume that had been produced during a single century since the Apostolic Age, probably surpassing the total number produced in all intervening centuries.' 
The error made by Adventists in 1844 was not in their timing, as the argument on the seventy weeks and the 2300 days in Daniel 9 has demonstrated. Rather, it was their misunderstanding of the nature of the event due to occur at the end of those days, as the argument on the sanctuary in Daniel 8 clarifies. They presumed the earth to be the sanctuary, and its cleansing would be through fire at the revelation of the Lord from heaven; thus, they awaited Christ's appearance at the end of the days.
This misconception led to a devastating disappointment, foretold in the Scripture itself, despite the prophecy's absolute accuracy and the fulfillment of their justified expectations. The cleansing of the sanctuary began then, but it didn't result in Christ's arrival on earth since the earth is not the sanctuary, and its cleansing does not necessitate the earth's destruction. Cleansing is carried out with the blood of a sacrificial offering, not with fire. This was the bitter disappointment of the Church as depicted in Revelation 10:10. It was not the arrival of the Son of Man on earth, but rather to the Ancient of days as described in Daniel 7:13, 14, and the Bridegroom's arrival at the wedding as presented in the parable of the ten virgins in Matthew 25.
According to this parable, the foolish virgins requested oil from the wise, as their lamps were going out. 'While they went to buy, the Bridegroom came.' This is not Christ's arrival on earth; it is a preliminary coming preceding the wedding. But before His return to earth to receive His people as guests at the wedding feast, the wedding – the reception of the kingdom (as explained in Revelation 21) – must occur. Therefore, the parable's coming must be the same as the arrival at the Ancient of days outlined in Daniel 7:13, 14 'Following the arrival of the Bridegroom at the wedding, 'they that were ready went in with Him to the marriage: and the door was shut.' The sequence of events that ensues involves an examination of the guests, ensuring they are prepared to partake in the sacred ceremony, as illustrated in the parable of Matthew 22: 1-13. The King himself steps in to scrutinize the attendees, determining if all are suitably garbed in the wedding attire. Each individual, after due appraisal, who is found donned in the wedding garment, and thus accepted by the King, is certain to never lose that garment, thereby securing their claim to immortality.
However, this decisive question of fitness for the kingdom can only be definitively settled through the investigative judgment of the sanctuary. This scrutiny, an indispensable part of the procedure, evaluates the worthiness of each individual to participate in the sacred and divine ceremony of the marriage. In essence, it is through this scrutiny that the fate of each individual is sealed, their destiny determined, and their place in the impending kingdom of the Lord confirmed. In this series of events, we find a perfect harmony and a celestial rhythm of divine plans unfolding, all culminating in the grand second advent of the Lord, an event awaited with great anticipation and devotion.'

The concluding task in the sanctuary, signifying the purification of the sanctuary and the atonement, bears an inherent semblance to the evaluation of the guests attending the divine wedding ceremony, ensuring they are adorned in the wedding garment. Until this task reaches its culmination, the certainty of who are 'ready' to join the divine ceremony remains nebulous. 'They that were ready went in with Him to the marriage.' These few words elegantly encapsulate the span from the moment when the Bridegroom appears at the wedding, progressing through the period of the sanctuary's cleansing and guests' scrutiny. The cessation of this process will mark the end of probation, ensuing the closure of the door.
The connection between the parable and the prophetic message under scrutiny is now vividly apparent. It unveils a period of preparation for the guests for the sacred marriage of the Lamb, which coincides with the commencement of the judgmental phase as asserted by the prophetic declaration, 'The hour of His judgment is come.' This prophecy, to be voiced aloud, resonated with profound influence during 1840-44, reaching a zenith in the autumn of the latter year. This period marked the cessation of the 2300 days and the initiation of the judgment process as Christ commenced the purification of the sanctuary.
As previously elucidated, this work did not signify the culmination of probation, rather it marked the onset of the investigative judgment. We find ourselves dwelling within this critical phase. Today, akin to the aforementioned period, the message of judgment is being broadcast to every corner of the earth. The solemn proclamation of judgment reverberates 'to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come.' - Revelation 14: 6, 7.
Before we proceed to consider the second angel's message, let us pause and reflect on the profound importance and the sublime significance of this magnificent truth so vividly unveiled. We stand on the precipice of the eternal world. The final offering of God's mercy is being disseminated to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. The concluding chapters in the grand narrative of salvation are being enacted in the heavenly sanctuary even at this very moment. Consider the gravitas! The hour of God's judgment is upon us. The investigative judgment, pertinent to every soul and preceding the advent of Jesus, is currently unfolding in the heavens. The wedding garment, a pristine robe of Christ's righteousness, has been made available at an immeasurable cost to all willing to accept it. Let us ponder - 'How will it fare with thee and me when the King comes in?' 'My little children, these things write I unto you, that you sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.' - 1 John 2: 1.
The Second Angel's Message. The timing of this message is inextricably tied to that of the first. Sequentially, the first message can't possibly precede the second, yet the scope of the first is confined to the epoch referred to as the last days. However, the second must be delivered before the final event, as no action of the kind described can occur after that. Therefore, it forms part of the spiritual movement transpiring in the last days, alluding specifically to the imminent advent of Christ.
Consequent queries emerge: What is the intended interpretation of 'Babylon'? What constitutes her fall? And how does it transpire? Insight into the meaning of the term is gleaned from the marginal readings of Genesis 10: 10 and 11: 9. The origin of Nimrod's kingdom was Babel, or Babylon. The locale was titled Babylon, signifying 'confusion,' as God disrupted the language of the tower builders at this site. The term is employed metaphorically here to designate the significant symbolic city featured in the book of Revelation, presumably with a particular emphasis on the connotation of the term and the circumstances that birthed it. It applies to an entity upon which the term 'confusion' may be used as a defining characteristic.
There exist merely three possible interpretations of the term: the apostate religious world in a general sense, the specific papal church, or the city of Rome. By examining these, we will initially delineate what Babylon is not.
Babylon does not exclusively represent the Roman Catholic Church. Undeniably, this church forms a pivotal component of great Babylon, a proposition that is unchallenged. The descriptions in Revelation 17 appear to pertain particularly to this church. However, the title she carries on her forehead, 'Mystery, Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth,' discloses additional familial connections. If this church is the mother, who are her offspring? The reference to these daughters demonstrates that entities other than the Roman Catholic Church are encapsulated under this term. Moreover, there is a call associated with this message: 'Come out of her, My people.' - Revelation 18: 1-4. As this message is anchored in the current generation, it suggests, if Babylon includes only the Roman Catholic Church, that God's people are presently within that church's communion and are beckoned to depart. This conclusion, at least, no Protestant would concede.
Babylon is not synonymous with the city of Rome. The argument to equate Babylon of the Apocalypse with the city of Rome hinges on this logic: The angel informed John that the woman he had seen represented the great city reigning over earthly kings, and that the beast's seven heads were seven mountains upon which the woman sat. By taking the city and the mountains literally and acknowledging Rome's foundation on seven hills, the application is directly made to literal Rome.
The underpinning principle of this interpretation is the assumption that a symbol's explanation must always be literal. This principle collapses once it can be demonstrated that symbols are sometimes explicated by substituting them with other symbols, which are then elucidated. This can be accomplished effortlessly. In Revelation 11: 3, the symbol of the two witnesses is introduced, followed by: 'These are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.' In this case, the first symbol is equated with another symbol that is explained clearly elsewhere. Similarly, in the current case, 'The seven heads are seven mountains,' and 'the woman is that great city.' Demonstrating that the mountains and the city are used symbolically is not a daunting task. Consider the following:
We are informed in Revelation 13 that one of the seven heads was fatally wounded. Therefore, this head cannot be a literal mountain, for the concept of inflicting a mortal wound on a mountain is ludicrous. Each of the seven heads is adorned with a crown. But has anyone ever witnessed a literal mountain crowned? These seven heads appear to succeed one another chronologically, as the passage reads, 'Five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come.' (Revelation 17: 10) Yet the seven hills upon which Rome is constructed do not succeed one another; thus, such a description applied to them would be absurd.

As per the verses of Daniel 7: 6, aligned with Daniel 8: 8, 22, the term 'heads' is symbolic of governments, and as per Daniel 2: 35, 44, and Jeremiah 51: 25, 'mountains' are metaphoric of kingdoms. Through these revelations, a literal interpretation of Revelation 17: 9, 10 dispels any vagueness: 'The seven heads are seven mountains on which on which the woman sitteth, and are seven kings.' It becomes clear then, that the angel embodies the heads as mountains, and subsequently interprets the mountains as seven sequential kings. The implication transitions from one symbol to another, and then an elucidation is rendered for the second symbol.
From the preceding argumentation, it is concluded that the 'woman' cannot embody a literal city, for since the mountains on which the woman is seated are symbolic, a literal city cannot possibly rest upon symbolic mountains. Moreover, Rome was the stronghold of the dragon as per Revelation 12, which was then transferred to the beast (Revelation 13: 2), thus becoming the beast's seat. It would be a rather peculiar blend of figures to consider the seat, which is occupied by the beast, and a woman perched on the beast as one and the same.
Should the city of Rome be the Babylon of the Apocalypse, the fall of Babylon as per Revelation 18: 1-4 would imply the toppling and obliteration of the city, indeed its absolute incineration as per verse 8. However, observe the events that unfold post the fall. Babylon transforms into 'the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.' Can such a metamorphosis occur to a city that has been decimated, even utterly consumed by fire? Moreover, subsequent to this, a voice resounds, stating, 'Come out of her, My people.' Are all of God's people located in Rome? Unlikely to a significant degree. How many could be there to heed the call to exit after the city has been scorched by flames? Additional argumentation seems superfluous to establish that Babylon cannot be the city of Rome.
So, What does Babylon Signify? Babylon epitomizes the global worldly church. Upon determining that it can't possibly represent either of the other two potential applications, this interpretation emerges as the plausible one. However, this topic doesn't rely on such reasoning alone. Babylon is referred to as 'a woman.' A woman, as a symbol, denotes a church. The woman of Revelation 12 was deciphered to represent a church. The woman of Revelation 17 should similarly be interpreted as signifying a church. The character of the woman dictates the nature of the represented church - a chaste woman symbolizes a pure church, a depraved woman stands for an impure or apostate church. The woman Babylon is characterized as a harlot, and the progenitor of daughters akin to her. This fact, coupled with the name itself, reveals that Babylon isn't confined to a solitary ecclesiastical entity, but is comprised of a multitude. It must encompass all of similar nature, representing the entire corrupt, or apostate, church of the earth. This might elucidate the scripture of Revelation 18: 24, which proclaims that when God demands retribution from great Babylon for the blood of His martyrs, within her will be discovered 'the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all' that have been martyred upon the earth.
Over the course of centuries, virtually every European nation has been governed by its state church, and most of these nations, even to this day, maintain their established religions, vigorously resisting those who dissent. Babylon has intoxicated all nations with the wine of her fornication, that is, her fallacious doctrines. Hence, it can symbolize nothing less than the global worldly church.
The formidable city of Babylon comprises three segments. Similarly, the major religions of the world can be categorized under three headings. The first, most ancient and widespread, is paganism, separately symbolized under the guise of a dragon. The second is the vast papal apostasy, symbolized by the beast. The third encompasses the daughters, or offsprings, of that church, symbolized by the two-horned beast, although not all are included. War, tyranny, worldly conformity, religious ritualism, the veneration of wealth, pursuit of pleasure, and the retention of numerous errors of the Roman Catholic Church, identify with a mournful and accurate precision the substantial body of the Protestant churches as a significant component of this great Babylon.
Such an exploration of Babylon in the biblical context reveals the profound complexity and depth of its meaning. As a metaphor for the universal worldly church, Babylon stands as an essential symbol for the understanding of biblical allegory. Its interpretation underlines the broader implications of religious apostasy and conformity, rendering a sobering depiction of the pitfalls of dogma and the misuse of spiritual power. As such, the study of Babylon, as represented in the scriptures, offers an essential lens into the moral and spiritual challenges confronting humanity.
Perusing the historical deportment of the Protestant church, we discern an alarming propensity for coercion and persecution. The grim specter of Rome's heretic-hunting is mirrored in the Protestant church's own ignominious past. One need only remember the burning of Michael Servetus at the hands of Geneva's Protestants, under the stewardship of John Calvin. Consider too the prolonged suppression of dissenters by the Church of England and the tragic executions of Quakers and public flogging of Baptists by the Puritan fathers of New England - themselves refugees from similar persecution by the Church of England. Some may argue that these are relics of a bygone era. However, they serve as an ominous reminder that individuals fueled by strong religious prejudice, when armed with the power to coerce dissenters, inevitably succumb to this temptation. Such a lamentable state of affairs is hinted at in the final prophecy of Revelation 13 and may re-emerge in this nation.
Christ's desire was for His church to exist in unity. He prayed for His disciples to be as one, just as He and the Father were one. This unity would endow His gospel with extraordinary potency and lead the world to believe in Him. Contrast this aspiration with the tumultuous discord prevalent in the Protestant world. The myriad of divisions fragment it into a complicated network of societies, each boasting its own creed, as varied and conflicting as the languages of those scattered at the tower of Babel. God is not the architect of such confusion. It is precisely this situation that the term 'Babylon' aptly describes - a term used for this specific purpose and not as a denigration. Instead of bristling at the mention of this term, individuals should introspect, examining their faith and practices to discern any affiliations with this monumental city of confusion. If found, they should sever ties without delay.
The authentic church is portrayed as a chaste virgin (2 Corinthians 11: 2). In contrast, the church that courts the world is a harlot. This illicit union with worldly powers renders her the grand harlot of the Apocalypse (Revelation 17). Thus, the Jewish Church, initially betrothed to the Lord (Jeremiah 2: 3; 31: 32), descended into debauchery (Ezekiel 16). Once this church fell from grace, it earned the ignominious title of Sodom (Isaiah 1), just as 'the great city' (Babylon) is so named in Revelation 11. Babylon's unlawful union with the world is incontrovertible proof that it is not a secular power. The presence of God's people amidst Babylon on the eve of her downfall is further evidence of her ostensible religious affiliation. For these reasons, it is unequivocal that the Babylon of the Apocalypse is the professed church wedded to the world.
Our next point of exploration is the fall of Babylon. Having elucidated the character of Babylon, it is simpler to comprehend the declaration of Babylon's fall. Given that Babylon is not a physical city, its fall cannot be a physical overthrow. We have previously noted the absurdities this interpretation would entail. Furthermore, the prophecy itself meticulously differentiates between Babylon's fall and its destruction. Babylon 'falls' prior to its violent 'throwing down,' akin to a millstone cast into the sea, and its subsequent immolation. Therefore, Babylon's fall is spiritual, for following its fall, God's voice implores His people, still among her ranks, 'Come out of her, My people.' The rationale given is 'that you be not partakers of her sins, and that you receive not of her plagues.' Thus, post-fall Babylon persists in sin, and her plagues remain a dreaded future prospect.

There are those who argue that Babylon's fall equates to the papacy's loss of civil authority. However, the aftermath of Babylon's fall is described as becoming a den of unclean spirits and hateful birds - a fate that Rome did not endure after losing its civil power. Furthermore, God's people are called upon to leave Babylon due to the amplified sinfulness that emerges following her fall. The papacy's loss of temporal power does not generate additional impetus for God's people to depart from that church.
Babylon's spiritual collapse is precipitated by 'her making all nations drink of the wine of the wrath [not anger, but intense passion] of her fornication.' This indictment can only pertain to one transgression - the propagation of false doctrines. She has defiled the pristine truths of God's word and intoxicated the nations with alluring fables.
In the guise of the papacy, she has attempted to supplant the gospel by endorsing an erroneous salvation system: Through the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, she negates the divine existence of God in Christ within human flesh. She endeavours to supersede Christ's mediation with an alternative system and strives to replace the priesthood of Jesus with an earthly clergy.

In a grave departure from the divine path, she predicates salvation on confession to mere mortals, thereby divorcing the sinner from Jesus, the only redeemer capable of absolving his transgressions. She proclaims the path of faith-based salvation as 'damnable heresy,' supplanting it with the doctrine that salvation lies in deeds, not faith. The zenith of her sacrilegious convictions is the doctrine of transubstantiation, or the idolatrous sacrifice of the mass, pronounced to be 'one and the same as that of the cross'. This act is claimed, in 'some senses,' to have 'the advantage over Calvary,' for through it 'the work of our redemption is carried out.'
She propounds several doctrines diametrically opposed to the Divine Word, including:
Substituting tradition and the voice of the church for the Bible as the infallible guide. Transforming the Sabbath, designated in the fourth commandment as the seventh day, into Sunday - a day of rest commemorating His resurrection, an uncommanded memorial incapable of properly honouring the event. Birthed from heathenism as 'the wild solar holiday of all pagan times,' Sunday was ushered by the pope into the gospel church as a hallowed institution, thereby striving to dismantle the divine memorial erected by God to celebrate His own grandiose creative work.
The belief in the natural immortality of the soul, an idea inherited from the pagan world, and embraced by the 'Fathers of the Church' as part of divine truth. This misconception obliterates the cardinal scriptural doctrines of resurrection and judgement, providing a gateway to modern spiritism. This error has spawned other deleterious doctrines such as the conscious state of the dead, saint worship, Mariology, purgatory, immediate reward upon death, prayers and baptisms for the dead, eternal torment, and universal salvation.
The conviction that saints, as disembodied spirits, receive their eternal inheritance in distant, nebulous regions 'beyond the bounds of time and space'. This misbelief has steered multitudes away from the scriptural concept that our present earth will be consumed by fire at the day of judgement, and that from its remains, Omnipotence will birth a new earth - the eternal kingdom of glory to be inherited by the saints.
Replacing immersion, the sole scriptural method of baptism, with sprinkling. This perversion of the sacrament paved the way for the substitution of Sunday's rest as a memorial to Christ's resurrection.
The teaching that Christ's return is a spiritual occurrence, realized at the destruction of Jerusalem, during conversion, at death, or in spiritism. Such doctrine has forever blinded many to the scriptural perspective that Christ's Second Coming is a future, tangible event, leading to the annihilation of His foes and eternal life for His followers.
The doctrine of a temporal millennium, promising a thousand years of peace, prosperity, and righteousness preceding Christ's Second Coming. This belief, particularly potent in closing the ears of the masses to the imminent signs of the Second Advent, is likely to lull countless souls into a state of earthly security, leading to their eventual downfall.
Turning to the prophecy regarding the fall of Babylon, we see the state of the religious world around the year 1844. Paganism, inherently corrupt, is incapable of spiritual decline. Roman Catholicism has languished in a fallen state for centuries. However, Protestant churches, initiating the formidable task of reforming from papal corruption, were in a position susceptible to a spiritual fall. Therefore, it seems irrefutable that the message announcing the fall pertained chiefly to Protestant churches.

One might ponder why such a proclamation was not heralded sooner if a significant portion of Babylon had long been fallen. The answer emerges quite clearly: Babylon, in its entirety, could not be declared fallen while a single division of it remained intact. Thus, the proclamation could not be issued until the Protestant world witnessed a decline, and the truth, which alone could illuminate the path forward, had been compromised. Once this shift transpired and a spiritual descent occurred in this final segment, then the declaration concerning Babylon as a whole could be issued – something that was previously impossible: 'Babylon is fallen.'
A further inquiry might concern how the reason assigned for Babylon's fall – that she compelled all nations to drink from the chalice of her spiritual adultery's wrath – could pertain to the Protestant churches of that era. It could indeed apply most fittingly. Babylon's sin resides in her distortion of the truth and subsequent propagation of false doctrines. Her relentless dissemination of these erroneous beliefs, even when faced with the light of truth capable of rectifying them, marks her fallen state.
For the Protestant churches, it was a critical juncture for ascending to loftier spiritual ground. They had the option of accepting the proffered enlightenment and attaining this higher state, or of rejecting it, thereby forfeiting their spiritual vitality and God's favour – in essence, experiencing a spiritual decline.
The divine truth that God chose to employ as a tool in this process was the first angel's message: the proclamation of God's judgement hour and Christ's impending Second Coming. After initially acknowledging the blessings associated with this doctrine and the positive impacts it wrought, the churches collectively rejected it, responding with disdain and derision. Such rejection served as their litmus test, clearly exposing that their hearts were aligned with the world, not the Lord, and that they preferred it thus.
However, this message could have remedied the religious world's existing maladies. The prophet Jeremiah, perhaps referring to this era, laments, 'We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed.' (Jeremiah 51:9). How do we ascertain that accepting the message would have brought about healing? The evidence lies in the transformative effects it had on those who did accept it: denominational barriers were dismantled, conflicting creeds shattered, the ill-founded hope of a temporal millennium abandoned, false views of the Second Coming rectified, pride and worldliness eliminated, wrongs righted, hearts united in tender fellowship, with love and joy reigning supreme. Had everyone accepted the doctrine, it would have wrought the same effects on all. However, the message was cast aside.
Across the land, the cry echoed, 'Babylon is fallen.' Anticipating the movement detailed in Revelation 18:1-4, the proclaimers of the message appended, 'Come out of her, My people.' As a result, thousands severed their affiliations with various denominations.
A pronounced transformation then washed over the churches concerning their spiritual status. When one rejects the light, darkness inevitably ensues; when truth is denied, the shackles of error inevitably bind. A spiritual fall, a loss of spirituality, must follow. This was the experience of the churches. They chose to cling to antiquated errors and continue disseminating their false doctrines. Consequently, the light of truth abandoned them.
Some among them recognized and lamented this change. A few testimonies from their authors of that era reveal their condition. The Christian Palladium, in 1844, spoke in the following mournful tone: 'In every direction we hear the dolorous sound, wafted upon every breeze of heaven, chilling as the blast from the icebergs of the north, settling like an incubus on the breasts of the timid, and drinking up the energies of the weak. Lukewarmness, division, anarchy, and desolation distress the borders of Zion.'
In the same year, the Religious Telescope offered this reflection: 'We have never witnessed such a general decline of religion as at present. When we call to mind how 'few and far between' cases of true conversion are, and the almost unparalleled impenitence and hardness of sinners, we almost involuntarily exclaim, 'Has God forgotten to be gracious? Or is the door of mercy closed?'' 

During that epoch, calls for fasts and periods of prayer for the return of the Holy Spirit were published in religious periodicals. Even the Philadelphia Sun, in November 1844, carried an announcement from various ministers and members of different denominations in Philadelphia and the vicinity. It read, 'The undersigned... solemnly believing that the present 'signs of the times' the spiritual dearth of our churches generally and the extreme evils in the world around us seem to call loudly on all Christians for a special season of prayer, do therefore hereby agree, by divine permission, to unite in a week of special prayer to Almighty God, for the outpouring of His Holy Spirit on our city, our country, and the world.' 
Prominent evangelist Charles G. Finney observed in February 1844, 'We have had the facts before our minds, that, in general, the Protestant churches of our country, as such, were either apathetic or hostile to nearly all the moral reforms of the age... The spiritual apathy is almost all-pervading, and is fearfully deep; so the religious press of the whole land testifies. The churches generally are becoming sadly degenerate. They have gone very far from the Lord, and He has withdrawn Himself from them.'
In November 1844, the Oberlin Evangelist noted, 'Some of our religious journals deplore, and all attest the fact that revivals have almost ceased in our churches. It is long since a period of so general dearth has been known... decline and death sit like an incubus on the bosom of Christian activity and of holy love for God as for souls... those seasons of 'refreshing from the presence of the Lord,' in which fearfulness surprises the hypocrite, conviction fastens on the sinner, and humble hearts cleave to the promises and wrestle for the conversion of souls those seasons are known only as they [are] held in sweet remembrance days that were, but are no longer.' 
This distinct loss of spirituality in 1844 was not an isolated occurrence. The decline has been significant and consistent ever since. In November 1858, The Congregationalist observed, 'The revived piety of our churches is not such that one can confidently infer, from its mere existence, its legitimate, practical fruits... But the managers of our societies are bewailing the feebleness of the sympathy and aid of the churches... Even a glance at the weekly journals of our own denomination will evince that the evil is no means confined to the Baptists.' 
In 1883, the prominent Methodist publication, the New York Christian Advocate, featured an article from which we extract these statements: '1. Disguise it as you like, the church, in a general sense, is spiritually in a rapid decline... It is assuming the shape and character of the church of Laodicea. 2. There are thousands of ministers, local and conference, and many thousands of the laity, who are dead and worthless as barren fig-trees...' 
In 1893, the editor of the Western Christ Advocate penned the following regarding his church: 'To the Church of Methodists, Write, the great trouble with us today is, that the rescue of imperiled souls is our last and least consideration. Many of our congregations are conducted on the basis of social clubs... Preachers are called who know how to 'Smooth down the rugged text to ears polite, And snugly keep damnation out of sight.'' This disconcerting situation, with a marked decline in spiritual commitment and a rising tide of apathy, became the unfortunate hallmark of this period, pointing to a broader concern within the religious landscape of the time.


'Sunday services, rather than embodying profound reverence, have instead morphed into exhibitions of the latest fashion trends. Even young children are garbed as if they were acolytes of vanity. If the 'Rules' are recited, it is but a mechanical observance of a law long abandoned in spirit. Our class-books are replete with names of unconverted men and women. Among the Church's official members, one can locate individuals in the opulence of the opera and theatre, partaking in races, attending card parties and dances. The distinction between the sanctity within the Church and the secular world has become blurred, causing some to question the necessity of joining the Church.
'When we approach the masses, it is often perceived as ostentatious condescension, driving them away. Despite this, our church has expanded, relying heavily on the support of the rich and ungodly. Enforcing the unambiguous letter of Discipline for a single year would halve our membership, bankrupt our Missionary Society, shut our fashionable churches, paralyze our connectional interests, and leave our pastors and bishops unpaid and in distress. Nevertheless, one of two things must transpire: the Discipline must cleanse the Church, or God's Holy Spirit will seek other organized agencies. The call is to repentance. God's work must be done. If we obstruct it, we will be set aside.' 
In the New York Independent of December 3, 1896, an article by D. L. Moody raised alarm over a reported lack of spiritual growth: 'In a recent issue of your paper, I saw an article... which stated that there were over three thousand churches in the Congregational and Presbyterian bodies of this country that did not report a single member added by profession of faith last year. Can this be true?... Should we not all lift up our voice like a trumpet about this matter?... And have we no care for the multitudes of souls going down to perdition every year while we all sit and look on? And this country of ours, where will it be in the next ten years, if we don't awake out of sleep?' 
This state of spiritual degeneration resulted in the churches' acceptance of erroneous doctrines, largely due to their rejection of the first angel's message. This shift towards falsehoods was particularly pronounced in the latter part of the nineteenth century, with the theory of evolution leading many religious leaders to, metaphorically, 'turn the Creator out of doors'. A proponent of this theory even posited that 'prayer is communion with my inner racial self.'
This acceptance of the theory of evolution had such a profound impact on the churches that it instigated public discourse. A philosophy professor in a prestigious university lamented: 'Today it seems that the great Hebrew-Christian moral tradition... is crumbling to pieces before our very eyes... The man who trusts a physical science to describe the world finds no conceivable place into which to fit a deity... The present conflict of religious faith with science is no longer with a scientific explanation of the world, but with a scientific explanation of religion. The really revolutionary effect of the scientific faith on religion today is not its new view of the universe, but its new view of religion.' 

A contemporary proponent of modern liberalism candidly declared, 'Liberal Protestants have abandoned belief in the verbal infallibility of the Bible.'  He further articulated, 'We believe that Jesus was a human being... he faced the problems and the difficulties of life with no secret reinforcements of miraculous power... Jesus' death is, in essence, no different from the death of other heroes.'  Regarding the Second Coming, he observed, 'Today the ancient belief that Jesus will reappear in the sky... has dwindled from a universally accepted and enormously influential Christian conviction to the esoteric doctrine of a minority.'  He concluded, 'We propose to take from the Christianity of the past the elements which seem of abiding value... shape a new formulation of the Christian message. We frankly admit that our gospel is not the 'old gospel,'... Ours is, we confess, a 'new gospel.'' 
The acceptance of the first angel's message by Protestantism would have positioned the Church as a beacon of enlightenment for 'all nations.' Yet, having rejected this message, the Church neglected her duty, leaving nations to flounder in the mire of falsehood and superstition born of a complex system of erroneous doctrines that she was unwilling to renounce.
Robert M. Hutchins, the president of the University of Chicago, voiced his perspective on our spiritual quandary, remarking, 'We do not know where we are going, or why... We are in despair because the keys which were to open the gates of heaven have let us into a larger but more oppressive prison house... They have failed us. We have long since cast off God. To what can we now appeal?' 
The Philadelphia Inquirer, in its May 24, 1941 issue, probed our predicament: 'We appear to have reached one of those portentous periods in history when civilization halts and stands aghast... Confronted by problems that can be disregarded by none but lighthearted children and lightheaded fools... For years there have been increasingly bitter assaults upon religion... we have reached the crossroads where every signpost points to bafflement... we and by 'we' is meant mankind in general have grown too cocksure of ourselves... the barrage balloons of our self-sufficiency are in process of being blasted out of the sky. Human creatures at last are beginning to discover that they are not little gods but only little men.' 
However, as mainstream churches continue to drift further from the Divine, they eventually reach a state of apostasy so severe that genuine believers can no longer align themselves with such institutions. At that juncture, they will be compelled to dissociate, a phenomenon we anticipate in the future, in line with Revelation 18: 1-4. We hold the conviction that this separation will occur when, alongside their spiritual decay, churches start to wield the hand of oppression against the faithful. (See comments on Revelation 18.)
The message of the Third Angel bears a formidable significance. In the entirety of the Bible, no warning of divine wrath is more severe. The sin cautioned against must surely be grave, and it must be presented with such clarity that those willing to understand may successfully avoid the judgments pronounced upon it.
These messages are recognized to be cumulative in nature; one does not abate with the arrival of the next. Thus, the first message proceeded solo for a time, followed by the introduction of the second, which did not terminate the first. From then on, there existed two messages. The third followed suit, supplementing rather than supplanting the prior ones, hence we currently have a trifecta of messages—or rather, a tripartite message—incorporating the truths of all three, with the last one naturally forming the climax of the proclamation. As long as the divine task persists, it will forever remain true that the hour of God's judgement has arrived, and that Babylon has fallen. These realities will persistently be declared in tandem with the truths conveyed by the third message.
A rational link among these messages is also evident. Surveying the scene just before the first message's advent, we witness a Protestant religious world sorely requiring reform. The churches suffered from internal divisions and confusion, obstinately clinging to various Papal fallacies and superstitions. The gospel's potency was thus weakened in their hands. To rectify these wrongs, the doctrine of Christ's Second Coming was introduced and proclaimed with vigor. The churches, however, refused to accept it, opting to endure the resulting spiritual ramifications. This paved the way for the second message, signaling the outcome of their refusal, an outcome that constituted not only a reality in itself but also a divine judgment on their faithlessness: God had deserted them, and they had suffered a spiritual fall.
Unmoved by the second message, they failed to rectify their errors, even though they had sufficient reason to do so, had they been willing to heed advice and correction. The outcome? A path is laid open for further deterioration, for expanded apostasy and escalating evils. If the churches persist in their course of shunning light and rejecting truth, they will eventually find themselves worshiping the beast and accepting his mark. This would be the predictable culmination of their actions, which began with the rejection of the first message.
Now, a new proclamation is issued, solemnly warning that any man who follows this path shall taste the wine of God's wrath, dispensed without dilution into the cup of His indignation. In other words, you dismissed the first message, resulting in a spiritual downfall. If you persist in denying the truth and disregarding warnings, you will deplete God's final means of grace, ultimately meeting with irremediable destruction. This warning is as harsh as God can impart in this life, and it is the final one. A handful will pay heed and find salvation, but the majority will heedlessly carry on, to their ruin.
The dissemination of the third angel's message is the specific religious initiative to be undertaken prior to the Lord's return. John envisions one akin to the Son of man arriving on a great white cloud to reap the earth's harvest immediately after this. This can only signify Christ's Second Coming. If, therefore, the arrival of Christ is imminent, the time has come for this message's proclamation. There are many earnestly asserting that we are in the end times and that Christ's return is imminent, yet they are left adrift without anchor, chart, or compass when reminded of this prophecy. They are at a loss as to how to handle it. They realize as we do that if their teachings about Christ's arrival are true and the Lord is nigh, the warning notes of this angel's 's message should echo far and wide across the land.
The reasoning set forth in the first two messages establishes the timeline of the third, demonstrating that it is indeed relevant to our present era. The strongest evidence that this message is currently being disseminated to the world is found in the events validating its fulfillment. The first message has been identified as a pivotal proclamation in the great Advent movement of 1840-1844. We have witnessed the realization of the second message in conjunction with that movement in the latter year. It is now incumbent upon us to scrutinize the occurrences since then.

In the aftermath of Christ's anticipated return in 1844, the Adventist community found itself entangled in a web of disillusionment and disarray. Numerous adherents abandoned the cause entirely, while others persisted, questioning the validity of the temporal argument, and seeking to recalibrate the prophetic timeline, a task they have pursued with varying degrees of diligence up until the present day, reestablishing a fresh date each time one passes unfulfilled. A select few pursued a meticulous and earnest examination of the source of the miscalculation, reinforcing their conviction in the advent movement's providential nature and the veracity of the time-focused argument, but recognizing an error in their interpretation of the sanctuary—a misapprehension that aptly elucidated the disappointment.
A thorough examination revealed that the sanctuary mentioned in Daniel 8:14 was not terrestrial as previously surmised. Its cleansing was not to be through fire, and the prophecy did not imply the Lord's return in any respect. Biblical exploration uncovered compelling evidence that the sanctuary referred to was the celestial temple, which Paul identifies as 'the sanctuary,' the 'true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched and not man.' Further inspection indicated that its purification, in alignment with the type, would involve the final ministration of the priest in the second chamber, the holy of holies. An understanding then emerged that the moment had arrived for the fulfillment of Revelation 11:19: 'The temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in His temple the ark of His testament.'
This celestial reference to the ark naturally led to an examination of the laws it contained. The very appellation of this object as 'the ark of His testament' necessitated that it housed the law. Thus, the heavenly ark was perceived as the grand antitype of the earthly ark of bygone, symbolic days. The law contained in this celestial ark was deemed the original law, of which the laws inscribed on the tablets of the earthly ark were mere copies. These laws must mirror each other exactly, in every letter and stroke. Any alternative assumption would imply deception.
Consequently, the law is still at the heart of God's governance, with its fourth commandment requiring the observance of the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath. This point remains undisputed among those who acknowledge the sanctuary argument.
As a result, the Sabbath reform came into view. It became evident that any action contravening this law—particularly the introduction of a day of rest and worship that usurped Jehovah's Sabbath—could only be the handiwork of the papal beast, the entity destined to oppose God, tamper with His laws, and exalt itself above the Almighty. This is precisely the scenario that prompts the third angel's warning, enabling believers from 1844 to discern that the period of the third angel's message coincides with the cleansing of the sanctuary, which commenced at the conclusion of the 2300 days in 1844, and is grounded on the profound truths unveiled by this subject.
The enlightenment of the third angel's message thus dawned upon the church. It was understood that those who professed to deliver this message would need to explain all the symbols it contained—the beast, the image, the worship, and the mark. These topics were therefore diligently scrutinized. The biblical testimony was clear and plentiful, enabling the formulation of definite statements and proofs explaining these elements.
The Message of Warning. The discussion delineating the beast, the image, and the mark has already been addressed in the commentary on Revelation 13. The two-horned beast, responsible for erecting the image and enforcing the mark, is identified as the United States of America. The third angel's message issues its warning against these actions and agents, providing further evidence that the message is timely and demonstrating an exquisite harmony within these prophecies. The established arguments need not be reiterated here; a brief summarization of the validated points should suffice.
The 'beast' symbolizes the Roman Catholic power. The 'mark of the beast' represents the institution that this power puts forward as a testament to its authority to legislate for the church and direct the consciences of men under sin. It signifies a modification of the law of God, through which the royal signature is erased from the law. The seventh-day Sabbath, the grand commemoration of Jehovah's act of creation, is detached from its position in the decalogue. A fabricated and deceptive Sabbath—the first day of the week—is erected in its place. This creates a dire situation where the fundamental principles of the faith are put to the test, and the message of the third angel is of utmost relevance, warning against this imminent spiritual crisis.

The 'image of the beast' represents an ecclesiastical amalgamation mirroring the beast's characteristics, notably the capacity to enforce its edicts with the stern sanctions of civil law. The 'two-horned beast,' under whose auspices the image gains the ability to express and act, symbolizes the United States of America, which is progressively evolving toward the formation of the beast's image.
The two-horned beast brings into effect the mark of the beast, thereby enshrining in law the observance of the first day of the week, also known as Sunday or the day of rest. Actions taken toward this objective have already been recognized. The motion is propelled by individuals and organized collectives, whose noble intentions become enmeshed with their vigorous advocacy for religious laws.
However, the populace is not kept in obscurity regarding this issue. The third angel's message delivers a grave denunciation against these misdeeds. It lays bare the activities of the beast, outlines the nature of its defiance of God's law, cautions the masses against acquiescing to its demands, and illuminates the path of truth for all. Such revelations inevitably stoke opposition, prompting the church to increasingly seek the leverage of human authority to bolster its doctrines, which are revealed to be distressingly devoid of divine endorsement.
What has been the impact of this message, and what presence does it command in the contemporary world? To respond to this inquiry, some remarkable facts can be offered. The inaugural publication advocating its cause was issued in 1849. Presently, this message is disseminated through books, tracts, and periodicals in 200 distinct languages, supported by 83 publishing houses distributed across the world, responsible for the publication of 313 periodicals. The value of its disseminated literature during 1942 totaled $5,467,664.99. Its evangelistic endeavors extend to 413 nations, with preaching conducted in over 810 languages.
Such a movement, at the very least, presents an intriguing phenomenon that requires explanation. We have identified initiatives that distinctly and precisely fulfill the first and second angel's messages. Now, another one steps forth, seeking the world's attention as the embodiment of the third message. It purports to fulfill this role, inviting global scrutiny of the credentials that substantiate its claim to such a status. Let us consider these credentials.
'The third angel followed them.' Accordingly, this movement trails the two previously noted ones. It perpetuates the propagation of truths they delivered, complementing them with the additional elements entailed in the third angel's message. The third message is typified as a caution against the beast. Therefore, this movement prominently features the elucidation of this symbol, informing the populace of its identity and laying bare its blasphemous pretensions and actions.
The third message warns all against venerating the beast. This movement elucidates how this beastly authority has introduced certain institutions into Christianity that challenge the edicts of the Almighty, demonstrating that our compliance with these institutions is tantamount to paying homage to this power. As stated by Paul, 'Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey?' (Romans 6:16).
The third message cautions all against accepting the beast's mark. This movement thus dedicates its endeavors to elucidating the nature of this mark and warning against its acceptance. It is especially committed to this task given the beast's cunning machinations that have hoodwinked the majority into unknowingly submitting to its authority. It is shown that the mark of the beast is an institution donned in Christian attire and surreptitiously infused into the Christian church in such a manner as to subvert Jehovah's authority and supplant it with that of the beast. When stripped of all its subterfuge, it merely establishes a spurious Sabbath of its own on the first day of the week, in lieu of the Lord's Sabbath on the seventh day. This is a usurpation that the supreme God cannot endure, and from which the remnant church must wholly extricate itself before it is ready for the Second Coming of Christ. Thus, the impassioned warning: Let no man venerate the beast or accept his mark.
The third message speaks against the veneration of the beast's image. Consequently, this movement likewise addresses this subject, revealing the nature of the image, or at the very least, interpreting the prophecy of the two-horned beast. It discloses the location of the formation of the image. The prophecy pertains to this generation; its fulfillment appears imminent.

There exists no religious endeavor at present, apart from that of the Seventh-day Adventists, claiming to be an embodiment of the third angel's message - none which primarily espouses the very themes encapsulated within this manuscript. How should we interpret these facts? Is this truly the fulfillment? Such must be the case unless its assertions can be debunked: unless it can be demonstrated that the messages of the first and second angels have not been broadcast; that the stances taken concerning the beast, the image, the mark, and the worship are not accurate; and that all the prophecies, signs, and evidences suggesting the imminent arrival of Christ, and therefore the due timing of this message, can be entirely dismissed. Such a task would not be lightly undertaken by the discerning student of the Bible.
The outcome of this proclamation, as articulated in verse 12, further affirms the validity of the positions adopted here. It gathers a group of individuals to whom it can be declared, 'Here are they that keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.' Within the very nucleus of Christendom, this work is being accomplished, and those who embrace the message are made distinct by their adherence to God's commandments. What distinguishes their practice, and what is the only distinction among Christians in this regard? Merely this: some believe that the fourth commandment is upheld by dedicating the first day of the week to rest and worship. Others assert that the seventh day is the one designated for such activities, and they arrange their time accordingly, resuming their regular labor on the first day. No clearer division could be drawn between two groups. The time that one group considers sacred and devotes to religious pursuits, the other views as entirely secular and dedicates to ordinary labor. One group, engaged in their worldly occupations, finds the other group withdrawn from all such endeavors, and the path of commercial interaction between them abruptly shut. Thus, for two days each week, these two groups are separated by their differing beliefs and practices concerning the fourth commandment. No other commandment could create such a noticeable division.
The Emphasis of the Sabbath in the Message. The third angel's message compels its followers to observe the seventh day, for only in this way are they made distinctive, given that the observance of the first day would not distinguish an individual from the multitude who were already observing that day when the message was introduced. In this, we find additional proof that Sunday observance is the mark of the beast, for the message, with its central focus on a warning against accepting the mark of the beast, will naturally lead its followers to reject the practice that constitutes the mark, and to adopt the opposite course. It indeed prompts them to abandon the observance of the first day of the week, and adopt that of the seventh day. In light of this, it becomes immediately apparent that there is more than an inference that Sunday observance is the mark of the beast against which we are warned, and that the observance of the seventh day stands in opposition to it.
This aligns with the argument on the seal of God, as presented in the commentary on Revelation 7. It was demonstrated there that sign, seal, mark, and token are interchangeable terms, and that God designates His Sabbath as His sign, or seal, in relation to His people. Therefore, God has a seal, which is His Sabbath. The beast has a mark, which is a counterfeit Sabbath. One is the seventh day, the other the first day. Christendom will ultimately be divided into precisely two classes: those sealed with the seal of the living God – that is, possessing His sign, or observing His Sabbath; and those who receive the mark of the beast – that is, possessing his sign , or observing his counterfeit Sabbath. With regard to this division, the third angel's message enlightens and cautions us.
Given the considerable significance attached to the seventh-day Sabbath, it is appropriate to bring forward the principal facts associated with the Sabbath institution. The Sabbath was established at the outset, at the closure of the first week of time (Genesis 2:1-3).
It was the seventh day of that week, and was grounded in truths that are indelibly linked with its name and existence - truths that can never be altered. God's cessation of labor on the seventh day christened it His day of rest, or the Sabbath (rest) of the Lord; it can never cease to be His day of rest, as that truth can never be revised. He sanctified, or set apart, the day at that time and place, as the record denotes; and that sanctification can never cease unless it is rescinded by an act from Jehovah as overt and unequivocal as that by which He conferred it upon the day at the outset. No one purports that this has ever occurred, and one would be hard-pressed to substantiate it if they did make such a claim.

The Sabbath possesses nothing of a typical or ceremonial nature, for it was instituted before mankind sinned, and thus belongs to a time when, by the very nature of things, a symbol or shadow could not exist.

The laws and precepts established before humanity's fall were primal in their essence, deriving from the relationship between God and man, and man and his fellow man. Such principles, untouched by man's sin, would have remained ever constant if man had never transgressed, for they are innately unchanging and eternal. Ceremonial and typical laws, on the other hand, arose as a consequence of man's sin, and were subject to alteration throughout different epochs; these alone were nullified at the cross. The Sabbath law, being a primal law, thus remains immutable and eternal.
The sanctification of the Sabbath in Eden underscores its continuity from creation to Sinai. Here, it was enshrined in the heart of the Decalogue as God's vocal proclamation and inscribed by His finger on tablets of stone—a distinction that forever distinguishes it from ceremonial laws and aligns it with the moral and eternal.
The Sabbath is not an arbitrary seventh day following six days of labor. The law from Sinai (Exodus 20: 8-11) precisely defines it. The events that initiated it (Genesis 2:1-3) restrict it to the specific seventh day. The 6,240 Sabbath miracles in the wilderness—three each week for forty years, a double portion of manna on the sixth day, preservation of the sixth-day manna on the seventh, and none on the seventh day (Exodus 16)—confirm that it is a particular day, not merely a ratio of time. To argue otherwise would parallel suggesting that Washington's Birthday or Independence Day represents only a 365th part of a year and could be commemorated on any day.
The Sabbath is a component of that law which our Lord emphatically announced He did not come to obliterate. Contrarily, He solemnly affirmed that it should persist in every detail while the earth remains (Matthew 5: 17-20). It is an element of that royal law, associated with King Jehovah, which James declares as a law of liberty, and which shall judge us on the final day. God does not employ different judgment standards for varying epochs of the world (James 2: 11, 12). It is the 'Lord's day' of Revelation 1:10.
The Sabbath reemerges as a significant institution regarding which significant reform is forecasted in the final days (Isaiah 56:1,2 compared with 1 Peter 1:5). In the forthcoming creation, the Sabbath, true to its genesis and nature, reappears, bestowing its blessings upon God's people throughout eternity (Isaiah 66:22,23).
This concise review of arguments demonstrates that the Sabbath law remains undiminished and the institution remains unaltered; and a person cannot claim to adhere to God's commandments unless he honors His day. Engaging with such an institution is a profound honor. Heeding its stipulations will confer limitless blessings.
Retribution for Beast Worshipers. These shall suffer torment with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and the Lamb. When is this torment inflicted? Revelation 19:20 indicates that at the Second Coming of Christ, there's a manifestation of fiery judgments, described as a lake of fire and brimstone, into which the beast and the false prophet are cast alive. This can only refer to the destruction inflicted at the outset, not at the conclusion, of the thousand years.
There's an extraordinary passage in Isaiah that explicates the phraseology of the third angel's threat, undoubtedly portraying scenes unfolding at the second advent and in the desolate state of the earth during the subsequent thousand years. The likelihood that Revelation's language was inspired by this prophecy is substantial. The prophet, after illustrating the Lord's wrath upon nations, the immense slaughter of their armies, and the heavens departing like a scroll, proclaims: 'It is the day of the Lord's vengeance, and the year of recompenses for the controversy of Zion. And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch. It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up forever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it forever and ever.' Isaiah 34: 8-10. Given the explicit revelation of a lake of fire where all sinners shall perish at the conclusion of the thousand years, we can deduce that the destruction of the living wicked at the onset of this era, and the ultimate fate of all the impious at its end, are mirror images of each other.

The phrase 'forever and ever' is not an assertion of eternity in this context. The evidence for this assertion lies in the nature of the punishment meted out on this earth, where the passage of time is marked by the cyclical transition of day into night. Further evidence may be drawn from the passage in Isaiah mentioned above, assuming this is the linguistic root from which the present text is derived and that it pertains to the same chronological context. The land of Idumea is the direct object of the prophecy in Isaiah, and whether this term is interpreted literally as the region of Edom, located southeast of Judea, or symbolically as a representation of the entire earth during the apocalyptic revelation of Lord Jesus in a cascade of celestial flames, the scene is ultimately transient. This earth is destined to undergo a transformation, purged of every trace of sin, every remnant of suffering and decay, to emerge as a new dwelling place of righteousness and joy for all eternity. The Greek word 'αιων', translated here as 'forever', is defined by G. Abbot-Smith in A Manual Greek Lexicon of the New Testament as 'a space of time, as, a lifetime, generation, period of history, an indefinitely long period'. Therefore, without distorting the accepted meaning of the Greek term, we can interpret it in a manner that aligns with other unambiguous scriptural statements.
The temporal span of the third angel's message is characterized as a period of patience for the faithful. Both Paul and James provide guidance on this matter (Hebrews 10: 36; James 5: 7, 8). During this period of waiting, the faithful keep the commandments of God - the ten commandments - and the faith of Jesus, which encompasses all the teachings of Christ and His apostles as contained in the New Testament. The authentic Sabbath, as outlined in the decalogue, stands in stark contrast with the counterfeit Sabbath, the mark of the beast, which ultimately distinguishes those who reject the third angel's message.
The gravity of events intensifies as we approach the culmination. This very reality lends the third angel's message, currently being disseminated, its extraordinary solemnity and significance. It is the final cautionary voice to be heard before the advent of the Son of Man, who is depicted here seated upon a pristine white cloud, adorned with a crown, and wielding a sickle, ready to reap the earth's harvest.
We are rapidly traversing a prophetic trajectory that culminates in the fiery revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven, exacting retribution upon His adversaries and bestowing rewards upon His saints. Furthermore, we have ventured so close to the fulfillment of this prophecy that the next inevitable link in the chain is this climactic and consequential event. Time, like a relentless river, never retreats. As rivers do not hesitate when faced with a precipice but force all floating bodies over with unyielding power; and as the seasons never deviate from their ordained course, with summer faithfully pursuing the budding fig tree, and winter swiftly following the descent of the falling leaf; we too are carried forward ceaselessly, willingly or not, prepared or unprepared, towards the inescapable and irrevocable crisis. The doom that looms large remains unimaginably distant to both the ostentatious believer and the indifferent sinner, and even those who understand and profess the truth struggle to truly apprehend its imminent reality.
A Blessing Foretold. A voice from heaven commands John to inscribe, 'Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth;' and the Spirit's concurrence is, 'Yea, . . . that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.' 'From henceforth' implies a specific point in time. Which point, precisely? Evidently, it denotes the inception of the message with which this is spoken. But why are those who perish subsequent to this moment blessed? This benediction must carry a distinct rationale. Is it not due to the fact that they evade the period of formidable danger that the saints confront as they conclude their journey? While they share this blessing with all righteous deceased, they undoubtedly hold a unique position as the group who are resurrected to eternal life in the specific resurrection prophesied in Daniel 12: 2.
Observing this prophetic trajectory, one notes that three angels preface the arrival of the Son of Man on the white cloud, and three more appear subsequently. The belief has been previously articulated that these are literal angels participating in the scenes described here. The first trio is entrusted with the three distinctive messages. The fourth angel's message appears to be voiced after the Son of Man completes His priestly duties and assumes His position on the white cloud, but before He manifests Himself in the heavenly clouds. This call to prayer from the church, once their work for the world is completed, the window of redemption has closed, and nothing remains but for the Lord to manifest and gather His people to Himself, resonates in the plea that our Lord references in Luke 18: 7, 8, associated with the arrival of the Son of Man. This plea will be answered; the chosen ones will be vindicated; for does the parable not declare, 'Shall not God avenge His own elect, which cry day and night unto Him?' He who sits upon the cloud will thrust His sickle, and the saints, represented as the wheat of the earth, will be harvested into the heavenly storehouse.
'He that sat on the cloud,' declares the prophecy, 'thrust in His sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.' With these words, we are transported beyond the second coming, transcending its concomitant scenes of cataclysm for the wicked and salvation for the virtuous. Thus, we must look past these scenes to discern the application of the ensuing verses.
The closing angels in this prophetic tableau are concerned primarily with the fate of the wicked, aptly symbolized by the dark, robust clusters of the earth's vine. Might it be inferred, then, that the final condemnation of such individuals at the terminus of the thousand-year period is portrayed here? It would seem that this prophecy is methodically crafting a conclusive disposition for both the virtuous and the wicked: the virtuous garbed in immortality and securely ensconced within the kingdom, and the wicked meeting their demise beyond the city's confines.
Application of this prophecy to the period of the second advent is improbable, considering the chronological sequence of events that is presented. For, the obliteration of the wicked would coincide with the gathering of the righteous. Furthermore, the living wicked experience the wrath of Christ's 'cup' during His advent. Yet, this passage elucidates the moment when they suffer in the 'winepress' of His wrath, said to be tread 'without the city', a portrayal aligning perfectly with Revelation 20: 9. This phrase seems to signify their comprehensive and ultimate annihilation.
The angel materializes from the temple, the repository of records and the place where penalties are decreed. His companion angel holds dominion over fire. This might have some relation to the fact that the ultimate annihilation of the wicked is executed through fire. To maintain the metaphor, the wicked are compared to clusters of the vine of the earth, destined to be thrown into the vast winepress trodden outside the city. Blood flows from the winepress, reaching up to the horses' bridles. The fate of the wicked is to be consumed by an overwhelming deluge of divine flame from the heavens. As to what preliminary carnage might occur within this doomed populace, we are left in uncertainty. It is not inconceivable that this prophecy may come to pass in a literal sense. Just as the first four angels signified a prominent shift amongst God's people, the final two could herald a similar shift. For the saints, it seems, are to partake in administering and executing the ultimate penalty on the wicked (1 Corinthians 6: 2; Psalm 149: 9).
This prophecy concludes as others have: with the unequivocal triumph of God, Christ, and the redeemed.
