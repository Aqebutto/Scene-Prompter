Gibbon, drawing upon the symbolic imagery of Daniel, offers this portrayal of the empire: The arms of the Republic, sometimes vanquished in battle, always victorious in war, advanced with rapid steps to the Euphrates, the Danube, the Rhine, and the ocean; and the images of gold, or silver, or brass, that might serve to represent the nations and their kings, were successively broken by the iron monarchy of Rome. At the dawn of the Christian Era, the empire encompassed the entirety of southern Europe, France, England, much of the Netherlands, Switzerland, southern Germany, Hungary, Turkey, and Greece, not to mention its holdings in Asia and Africa.",
