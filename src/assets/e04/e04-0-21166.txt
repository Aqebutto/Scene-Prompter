We are to interpret all Scriptural language literally, except when there is a compelling reason to consider it as figurative. Every figurative expression should be explained by its literal counterpart. The language employed here is evidently symbolic, as evident in verse 17: "These great beasts, which are four, are four kings which arise out of the earth." The implication of kingdoms, rather than merely individual kings, is discernible from the phrase, "But the saints of the Most High shall take the kingdom." In clarifying verse 23, the angel stated, "The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon the earth." Thus, these beasts symbolize four grand kingdoms. The conditions under which they emerged, as represented in the prophecy, are also articulated in symbolic language. The symbols introduced include the four winds, the sea, four immense beasts, ten horns, and another horn with eyes and a mouth, waging war against God and His people. Our task now is to discern their meanings.
In symbolic language, winds signify strife, political upheaval, and war, as articulated by the prophet Jeremiah:
"Thus said the Lord of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth. And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth." Jeremiah 25: 32, 33. The prophet discusses a dispute which the Lord will have with all nations. The strife and commotion generating this devastation is referred to as "a great whirlwind."
The fact that winds symbolize strife and war is evident within the vision itself. As a result of the winds' blowing, kingdoms rise and fall through political conflict.
Seas, or waters, when employed as a Biblical symbol, denote peoples, nations, and tongues. The angel informed the prophet John, "The waters which thou saw . . . are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues." Revelation 17: 15.
The symbol of the four beasts is defined for Daniel before the vision concludes: "These great beasts, which are four, are four kings which shall arise out of the earth." Verse 17. With this elucidation of the symbols, the vision's scope is unequivocally laid before us.
As these beasts signify four kings or kingdoms, we must ask, where do we begin and which four empires are represented? These beasts arise sequentially, as they are numbered from the first to the fourth. The final one exists when all earthly events conclude with the ultimate judgment. From Daniel's time until the end of the world's history, there were to be only four universal kingdoms, as we learned from Nebuchadnezzar's dream of the grand image in Daniel 2, interpreted by the prophet sixty-five years prior. Daniel was still living under the kingdom symbolized by the head of gold.
The first beast of this vision must, therefore, represent the same kingdom as the head of gold of the grand image, namely, Babylon. The other beasts likely symbolize the successive kingdoms depicted by that image. However, if this vision spans essentially the same historical period as the image in Daniel 2, one might question its necessity. Why was the first vision not sufficient? In response, we assert that the history of world empires is revisited time and again to reveal additional characteristics and present further facts and features. It is in this manner that we receive "line upon line" according to the Scriptures. In chapter 2, only the political aspects of world dominion are illustrated. Here, earthly governments are presented in relation to God's truth and God's people. Their true nature is exposed through symbols of wild and ravenous beasts, thereby providing a more profound understanding of their roles and behaviors. Each subsequent exploration of these empires offers a deeper and richer perspective, allowing us to fully grasp the intricate interplay between divine guidance and human ambition throughout history.

The Majestic Lion. In Daniel's 7th vision, the initial beast that appears to the prophet is a lion. To comprehend the symbolic use of a lion, we can refer to Jeremiah 4:7; 50:17, 43, 44. In this particular vision, the lion is portrayed with the wings of an eagle. The emblematic application of wings is vividly depicted in Habakkuk 1:6-8, where it is described that the Chaldeans shall "fly as the eagle that hastes to eat."
From these symbolic representations, we can infer that Babylon was a kingdom of immense strength, and under Nebuchadnezzar's reign, its conquests expanded with remarkable swiftness. However, an era arrived when the wings were plucked. The nation no longer pounced upon its prey akin to an eagle. The courage and vigor of the lion had vanished. In its stead, a man's heart—feeble, apprehensive, and faint—replaced the formidable strength of a lion. This accurately described the condition of the nation during its final years, as it had grown weak and effete through indulgence in wealth and luxury.

Analogous to the image in Daniel 2, this series of symbols reveals a noticeable decline as we progress from one kingdom to the next. The silver of the breast and arms is inferior to the gold of the head, just as the bear is inferior to the lion. Medo-Persia lacked the wealth, splendor, and brilliance of Babylon. The bear raised itself up on one side, signifying the dual nationalities of the Medes and Persians. This fact is also represented by the two horns of the ram in Daniel 8. It is said that the higher horn came up last, and likewise, the bear raised itself up on one side. This prophecy was fulfilled as the Persian division of the kingdom, although emerging later, ultimately attained greater prominence, becoming the dominant force in the nation. (See commentary on Daniel 8:3.) The three ribs likely symbolize the three provinces of Babylon, Lydia, and Egypt, which were particularly subjugated by Medo-Persia. The command, "Arise, devour much flesh," seemingly refers to the invigoration experienced by the Medes and Persians upon the subjugation of these provinces. The nature of this power is aptly depicted by a bear. The Medes and Persians were renowned for their cruelty and rapacity, seizing and plundering the people. The Medo-Persian kingdom persisted from the fall of Babylon under Cyrus until the Battle of Arbela in 331 BC, spanning 207 years.


The third kingdom, Greece, is symbolized by the figure of a leopard. If wings upon the lion represented swiftness in conquest, they would convey the same meaning here. The leopard itself is known for its agility, but this alone was not adequate to portray the nature of the nation in question. It required wings in addition to its inherent swiftness – not just two, as the lion bore, but four. This imagery suggests an unparalleled velocity of movement, which is historically accurate in the case of the Grecian kingdom. The conquests of Greece under Alexander were unrivaled in antiquity for their suddenness and speed. W. W. Tarn summarizes his military accomplishments:
Alexander was a master of combining various arms; he introduced the world to the advantages of winter campaigning, the importance of relentless pursuit, and the principle of 'march divided, fight united.' He usually marched in two divisions, with one managing the impediments while his own division traveled light. His extraordinary speed was attributed to "never putting anything off." The vast distances covered in uncharted territory demanded exceptional organizational skills; within ten years, he faced only two significant setbacks. Had a lesser man attempted his achievements and failed, the insurmountable military difficulties of the undertaking would have been widely criticized.
"The beast had also four heads." The unity of the Grecian Empire endured little longer than Alexander's lifetime. Following his dazzling career, which ended with a fever brought on by a drunken spree, the empire was divided among his four top generals. Cassander ruled Macedonia and Greece in the west; Lysimachus governed Thrace and parts of Asia on the Hellespont and Bosphorus in the north; Ptolemy controlled Egypt, Lydia, Arabia, Palestine, and Coele-Syria in the south; and Seleucus presided over Syria and the remaining eastern dominions of Alexander. By 301 BC, with the demise of Antigonus, the division of Alexander's kingdom into four parts was completed by his generals. These divisions were represented by the four heads of the leopard.
Thus, the prophetic words were precisely fulfilled. As Alexander left no suitable heir, why did his vast empire not fragment into innumerable minor pieces? Why did it divide into precisely four parts? The answer lies in the prophecy that foresaw and foretold this outcome. The leopard bore four heads, the rough goat had four horns, and the kingdom was to be divided into four segments – and so it came to pass.


The power depicted here is so distinct from all others that inspiration finds no existing creature to serve as its symbol. No combination of hoofs, heads, horns, wings, scales, teeth, or nails from any beast in nature would suffice. This power is entirely unlike its predecessors, and its representation is entirely unique, unlike any creature found in the animal kingdom.
Verse 7 lays the groundwork for an extensive analysis, but due to space constraints, we must offer a concise overview. This beast corresponds to the fourth division of the great image, the legs of iron. The commentary on Daniel 2:40 provides reasons to identify this power as Rome, and these reasons apply to the current prophecy as well. Rome impeccably embodied the iron portion of the image and the beast described here. Its unparalleled might and the dread it inspired align perfectly with the prophetic portrayal. The world had never witnessed such a formidable power. It devoured with iron teeth and shattered all obstacles in its path. It crushed nations beneath its unyielding feet. The beast possessed ten horns, which are explained in verse 24 as ten kings or kingdoms that would emerge from this empire. As previously discussed in the commentary on Daniel 2, Rome was divided into ten kingdoms. These divisions have since been referred to as the ten kingdoms of the Roman Empire.

Daniel observed the horns with keen interest. An unusual development emerged among them, as another horn—initially small but later more robust than its companions—forced its way upward. This new horn was not satisfied with merely finding a place for itself; it sought to displace others and seize their positions. Consequently, three kingdoms were uprooted.
The Emergence of a Little Horn. As we will explore in more detail later, this little horn represents the papacy. The three uprooted horns symbolize the Heruli, Ostrogoths, and Vandals, whose removal stemmed from their opposition to the doctrines and assertions of the papal hierarchy.
This horn possessed "eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things," apt symbols for the astuteness, insight, and audacious claims of a wayward religious institution.


A more sublime and awe-inspiring scene is scarcely found within the pages of the sacred text. Not only the grand and lofty imagery captivates our attention, but the very nature of the scene itself demands the utmost gravity, as the judgment concerns us all in matters of eternal consequence.
An unfortunate translation in verse 9 may convey an incorrect impression. The phrase "cast down" derives from the Chaldee word 'remi,' which can be aptly translated as "hurled by violence," as demonstrated when used to describe the casting of the three Hebrews into the fiery furnace and Daniel into the den of lions. However, another equally accurate translation is "to set or place in order," as with the placement of judgment seats mentioned here, and similarly in Revelation 4:2, where the Greek supports the same meaning. The Revised Version in Daniel 7:9 appropriately reads "thrones were placed," as Gesenius defines the root 'remah,' citing Daniel 7:9 as an example.
The "Ancient of Days," God the Father, presides over the judgment. Observe the description of His person. Those who believe in the impersonality of God must concede that He is portrayed here as a personal being, yet they console themselves by claiming this to be the sole description of its kind in the Bible. We do not accept this latter assertion; however, even if it were true, would not one such description be as detrimental to their belief as if it were repeated twenty times? The innumerable thousands who minister unto Him and stand before Him are not sinners brought before the judgment seat, but heavenly beings attending to His will. John witnessed the same celestial attendants around the throne of God and described the majestic scene: "I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands" (Revelation 5:11). A more profound comprehension of these verses requires an understanding of the sanctuary services.
The conclusion of Christ's ministry, our great High Priest, within the heavenly sanctuary, represents the judgment work introduced here. It is an investigative judgment. The books are opened, and the cases of all are examined before that grand tribunal, determining in advance who shall receive eternal life when the Lord comes to bestow it upon His people. As evident from the testimony of Daniel 8:14, this solemn work is currently underway in the sanctuary above.

There exist those who advocate for a thousand-year reign of righteousness across the globe before Christ's arrival. Others believe in a period of probation following the Lord's coming, during which the immortal righteous continue to preach the gospel to mortal sinners, guiding them towards salvation. Nevertheless, neither of these theories can be substantiated by the scriptures, as we shall demonstrate.
The fourth fearsome beast persists, unaltered in nature, while the little horn continues to issue its blasphemies, binding millions of followers in the chains of blind superstition until the beast is consigned to the burning flame. This is not a conversion, but rather its destruction (2 Thessalonians 2:8).
Unlike the preceding beasts whose lives were extended after their dominion ceased, the fourth beast's life is not prolonged. The territories and subjects of the Babylonian, Persian, and Grecian kingdoms persisted, albeit subjugated to their successors. However, what follows the fourth kingdom? No mortal government or state succeeds it. Its trajectory culminates in the lake of fire, with no existence beyond. The lion transitioned into the bear, the bear into the leopard, and the leopard into the fourth beast. Yet the fourth beast does not amalgamate into another entity; instead, it is destined for the lake of fire.

The scene depicted here does not represent the Second Coming of Christ to Earth, for the Ancient of Days is not on this Earth, and the arrival mentioned here is directed towards the Ancient of Days. It is in the presence of the Father that dominion, glory, and a kingdom are bestowed upon the Son of Man. Christ acquires His kingdom prior to His return to this Earth (Luke 19:10-12). Thus, this is an event that transpires in Heaven, intimately connected with the occurrences delineated in verses 9 and 10. Christ obtains His kingdom upon the completion of His priestly duties in the sanctuary.
The people and nations destined to serve Him are the redeemed (Revelation 21:24), not the wicked nations of the Earth, for they shall be annihilated at Christ's Second Coming by the radiance of His arrival (Psalm 2:9; 2 Thessalonians 2:8). From all nations, tribes, and kindreds of the Earth, those who joyfully serve God shall emerge. They are the ones who will inherit the kingdom of our Lord.


Vision Interpreted for Daniel. Our concern for comprehending these truths should be no less profound than Daniel's. We can be assured that when we inquire with genuine sincerity, we will discover the Lord is as prepared today as He was in the days of the prophet to guide us toward a correct understanding of these significant truths. The beasts and their corresponding kingdoms have been explicated already. We have accompanied the prophet through a series of events, culminating in the annihilation of the fourth beast and the ultimate collapse of all terrestrial governments. Subsequently, the narrative transitions, as we learn that "the saints... shall take the kingdom" (Verse 18).
The saints, often derided, reproached, persecuted, and cast out, deemed the least likely among all ever to realize their aspirations, are the ones who shall seize the kingdom and possess it eternally. The wicked's usurpation and maladministration shall cease. The inheritance lost due to sin shall be reclaimed. Peace and righteousness shall perpetually preside over the vast expanse of the renewed Earth.

Truth of the Fourth Beast. Daniel possessed a lucid understanding of the first three beasts in this vision. However, the fourth beast astonished him due to its unnatural and fearsome nature. It was primarily concerning this beast and its ten horns, particularly the last emerging little horn "whose look was more stout than his fellows," that he sought additional information. The lion, as a creature of nature, must have two wings added to represent the kingdom of Babylon. Likewise, the bear is found in nature, but to symbolize Medo-Persia, an unnatural ferocity must be denoted by the three ribs in its mouth. Similarly, the leopard is a natural creature, but to accurately represent Greece, four wings and three additional heads must be incorporated. However, nature offers no symbol capable of aptly illustrating the fourth kingdom. Consequently, the vision introduces a beast, the likes of which had never been seen before: a dreadful and terrifying creature with brass nails and iron teeth, so barbarous, rapacious, and fierce that it devoured, shattered, and trampled its victims beneath its feet, solely out of love for oppression.
As astounding as all this was to the prophet, there was an even more remarkable feature that captured his attention: a little horn emerged, and true to the nature of the beast from which it originated, displaced three of its counterparts. Behold, the horn possessed eyes—not the unrefined eyes of a brute, but the keen, shrewd, and intelligent eyes of a man. Stranger still, it had a mouth that uttered haughty sayings and advanced outrageous and arrogant claims. It is no wonder that the prophet inquired specifically about this monstrous entity, so unearthly in its instincts and so fiendish in its actions and ways. In the subsequent verses, some details are provided regarding the little horn, enabling the student of prophecy to apply this symbol without the peril of error.


The extraordinary wrath of this little horn against the saints particularly captivated Daniel's attention. The emergence of the ten horns, or the division of Rome into ten kingdoms between AD 351 and 476, has already been discussed in commentary on Daniel 2:41.
Since these horns represent kingdoms, the little horn must also symbolize a kingdom, albeit of a different nature, as it was distinct from the others. They were political kingdoms, and thus, one must inquire if any kingdom has arisen among the ten divisions of the Roman Empire since AD 476, which was dissimilar to them all; and if so, which one? The answer is the spiritual kingdom of the papacy. This power aligns with the symbol in every detail, as we shall observe in due course.
Daniel saw this power waging war upon the saints. Has the papacy engaged in such a war? Countless martyrs affirm this fact. Consider the brutal persecution of the Waldenses, the Albigenses, and Protestants in general by the papal authority.
In verse 22, three consecutive events seem to be presented. Gazing forward from the time when the little horn was at the height of its power to the ultimate conclusion of the protracted struggle between the saints and Satan with all his agents, Daniel identifies three significant events that serve as milestones along the path:
The arrival of the Ancient of days, referring to the position Jehovah assumes in the commencement of the judgment scene described in verses 9 and 10.
The judgment that is bestowed upon the saints, indicating the period when the saints sit with Christ in judgment for a thousand years, following the first resurrection (Revelation 20: 1-4), allocating to the wicked the punishment deserved for their transgressions. During this time, the martyrs will judge the formidable persecuting power, which, in their days of tribulation, pursued them like desert beasts and spilled their blood like water.
The moment the saints inherit the kingdom, signifying their entry into the possession of the new earth. At this point, every last trace of the curse of sin, and sinners, both root and branch, will have vanished, and the territory so long misgoverned by the wicked powers of earth, the adversaries of God's people, will be bequeathed to the righteous, to be held by them in perpetuity.
