Both nature and divine revelation serve as eloquent witnesses to God's profound love. Our Heavenly Father is the originator of life, the wellspring of wisdom, and the beacon of joy. Observe the exquisite and splendid elements of nature, marvel at their ingenious adaptation for the welfare and delight of not only mankind but all living beings. The rejuvenating sunshine and rain, the majestic hills, vast seas, and sweeping plains, all resonate with the narrative of the Creator's love. It is God who graciously provides for the daily sustenance of all His creatures. In the poetic words of the psalmist—

“The eyes of all wait upon Thee;
And Thou givest them their meat in due season.
Thou openest Thine hand,
And satisfiest the desire of every living thing.”
Psalm 145:15, 16.

God created humanity in a state of perfect sanctity and joy; and the pristine earth, emerging from the Creator’s hands, was untouched by decay or the curse’s shadow. It is the breach of God’s law—the law of love—that has introduced sorrow and mortality. Even amidst the anguish birthed by sin, God’s love remains manifest. Scripture records that God cursed the ground for humanity's benefit (Genesis 3:17). Thorns and thistles, symbolizing life's hardships and tribulations, were designated for our benefit as essential elements in God's design for elevating us from the devastation caused by sin. The world, though impaired, is not entirely composed of grief and despair. In nature itself, we find uplifting messages and solace. Even among thistles bloom flowers, and roses adorn the thorns.

“God is love” is inscribed upon each unfolding bloom, every blade of grass that springs forth. The melodious birds filling the air with their joyous songs, the exquisitely hued flowers emitting their sweet fragrance, the towering trees clothed in verdant foliage—all bear testament to our God's gentle, paternal care and His intent to bestow happiness upon His children.

The Word of God illuminates His character. He has personally revealed His boundless love and compassion. When Moses yearned to see His glory, God responded, “I will make all My goodness pass before thee” (Exodus 33:18, 19). This is the essence of His magnificence. God appeared before Moses, declaring Himself as merciful, gracious, patient, rich in kindness and truth, maintaining mercy for multitudes, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin (Exodus 34:6, 7). He is patient and immensely benevolent, delighting in mercy (Jonah 4:2; Micah 7:18).

God has linked our hearts to His through countless symbols in heaven and earth. Utilizing the elements of nature and the deepest, most profound earthly bonds that human hearts can experience, He has endeavored to reveal Himself to us. Yet, these only partially represent His love. Despite these manifestations, malevolent forces have obscured men's perceptions, leading them to view God with apprehension and dread; they perceived Him as severe and unforgiving. Satan has misled humanity to envision God as a deity primarily characterized by stern justice—a stringent judge, a demanding creditor, vigilantly scrutinizing human errors and missteps to dispense judgment.

To dispel this misconception and unveil the limitless love of God, Jesus Christ descended to dwell among us. The Son of God emerged from the celestial realms to manifest the Father. “No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him” (John 1:18). “Neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him” (Matthew 11:27). When asked to reveal the Father, Jesus responded by affirming that to see Him was to see the Father (John 14:8, 9).

Describing His earthly mission, Jesus stated that He was anointed by the Lord “to preach the gospel to the poor; to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are bruised” (Luke 4:18).
This was the essence of His mission. He traversed the land, dispensing goodness and alleviating the suffering of those burdened by Satan's oppression. Entire villages were liberated from the clutches of illness, for His healing presence had graced them, restoring health to all afflicted. His deeds bore witness to His divine consecration. In every facet of His existence, love, mercy, and compassion were evident; His heart radiated with empathetic warmth towards humanity. Embracing human form, He endeavored to address human needs. The most destitute and lowly found solace in His presence. Even children were drawn to Him, captivated by His countenance, radiant with benevolence.

Jesus never withheld truth, articulating it always with heartfelt love. His interactions with people were marked by utmost finesse and considerate attention. He never engaged in rudeness, never uttered harsh words without necessity, nor caused unwarranted anguish to a tender spirit. He did not criticize human frailty. He proclaimed truth, but always with love. He confronted hypocrisy, disbelief, and wickedness; yet his voice quivered with emotion as He expressed His stern admonishments. He mourned for Jerusalem, the city He cherished, which spurned Him, the embodiment of truth and life. Though they rebuffed their Savior, He viewed them with compassionate sorrow. His existence was characterized by self-abnegation and meticulous concern for others. Every soul held immeasurable worth in His eyes. He carried Himself with celestial dignity, yet extended the gentlest compassion to all God's children. He perceived in every individual a fallen soul He was destined to redeem.

Such was the nature of Christ as demonstrated through His life, mirroring the character of God. From the Father’s heart emanate the rivers of divine compassion, manifested in Christ, pouring forth to humanity. Jesus, the compassionate and tender Savior, was the divine incarnate. “Manifest in the flesh” as stated in 1 Timothy 3:16.

Jesus’ life, suffering, and demise were dedicated to our redemption. He embraced the mantle of “a Man of Sorrows,” so we might partake in perpetual bliss. God allowed His beloved Son, replete with grace and truth, to descend from a realm of unfathomable splendor to a world tainted and shadowed by sin, death, and the curse. He permitted Him to depart from His loving embrace, from the adulation of angels, to endure ignominy, insult, abasement, hostility, and death. “The chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes we are healed” (Isaiah 53:5). Behold His trials in the wilderness, in Gethsemane, and upon the cross! The immaculate Son of God bore the weight of sin. He, once united with God, experienced the profound estrangement sin causes between God and humanity. This anguish elicited His pained cry, “My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?” (Matthew 27:46). It was the burden of sin, its overwhelming magnitude, its severance of the soul from God, that shattered the heart of the Son of God.

Yet, this monumental sacrifice was not to engender love in the Father's heart for humanity, nor to incite His willingness to save. Rather, “God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son” (John 3:16). The Father’s love is unconditional, not predicated on this great atonement, but He provided this atonement out of His love. Christ served as the conduit through which His boundless love was bestowed upon a fallen world. “God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself” (2 Corinthians 5:19). God shared in His Son’s suffering. In the throes of Gethsemane and the crucifixion at Calvary, the heart of Infinite Love paid the ultimate price for our redemption.
Jesus proclaimed, “Therefore doth My Father love Me, because I lay down My life, that I might take it again” (John 10:17). This signifies, “My Father’s love for you is so profound that He cherishes Me even more for offering My life to redeem you. In assuming the role of your Redeemer and Guarantor, by relinquishing My life, by bearing your burdens and transgressions, I become even more precious to My Father; for through My sacrifice, God remains just, while also justifying those who believe in Jesus.”

None but the Son of God could achieve our salvation; only He, who resided in the intimate embrace of the Father, could fully reveal Him. Only He, who comprehended the full magnitude of God's love, could manifest it. Nothing short of the boundless sacrifice made by Christ on behalf of fallen mankind could adequately convey the Father’s love to a humanity estranged from Him.

“God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son.” He bestowed Him not merely to dwell among humans, to carry their sins, and to be their ultimate sacrifice. He presented Him to a fallen race. Christ became one with humanity, aligning Himself with our interests and necessities. He who was in unity with God formed an unbreakable bond with humankind. Jesus is “not ashamed to call them brethren” (Hebrews 2:11); He stands as our Sacrifice, our Intercessor, our Brother, presenting our human condition before the Father’s throne, eternally unified with the race He has saved—the Son of Man. All this, so that mankind might rise from the ruins and degradation of sin, to mirror God’s love and partake in the joy of sanctity.

The immeasurable price of our redemption, the infinite sacrifice made by our heavenly Father in offering His Son for us, should elevate our understanding of what we can achieve through Christ. As the inspired apostle John contemplated the vastness, the depth, the expanse of the Father’s love towards a perishing humanity, he was overwhelmed with awe and reverence. Finding no words adequate to express the enormity and tenderness of this love, he implored the world to witness it. “Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God” (1 John 3:1). Such is the value attributed to mankind! Through sin, the sons of man became subjects of Satan. Yet, through faith in Christ’s atoning sacrifice, the sons of Adam are reborn as sons of God. By embracing human nature, Christ uplifts humanity. Fallen men are positioned, through their bond with Christ, to truly merit the designation “sons of God.”

Such love is unparalleled. Children of the celestial Sovereign! A treasured promise! A subject worthy of the deepest contemplation! The unparalleled love of God for a world that did not reciprocate His affection! This realization has a transformative effect on the soul, aligning the human mind with God’s will. The more we delve into the divine nature in the context of the crucifixion, the more we observe a blend of mercy, gentleness, and forgiveness harmonized with fairness and justice, and the more vividly we recognize countless manifestations of a love that is limitless and a compassion that exceeds a mother’s deepest empathy for her errant child.
“Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ.” Romans 5:1.
The necessity for discourse on the concept of justification by faith is unquestionable. This principle forms the bedrock of Christian experience and the fundamental element in the gospel's transformation of the human heart. Its importance cannot be overstated, and despite the profundity of discussion it might receive, the entirety of its truth remains elusive to the limits of human expression and cognition.
Justice, as elucidated by Webster, embodies the essence of fairness; it entails dispensing each individual their due and adhering to righteousness and obligation. Righteousness echoes this meaning, representing the state of being correct or morally upright.

These terms apply in two distinct senses; thus, justification or righteousness manifests in two forms. The first is righteousness achieved through complete obedience, referenced by Paul in Romans 2:13, “The doers of the law shall be justified.” Regrettably for humanity, as Paul expounds, perfect doers of the law do not exist, leading to the conclusion in Romans 3:20 that no one can be justified by the law's deeds. Yet, this does not negate the principle that absolute obedience to the law would result in justification. The Scriptures assert, “Fear God, and keep his commandments; for this is the whole duty of man.” It is undeniable that had humanity fulfilled its entire duty, it would stand justified before God, with no basis for condemnation. This hypothetical justification by works is now unattainable for humanity, as all have strayed in our fallen state.

The second form of justification or righteousness, the focus of Paul’s discourse in Romans, is the conceptualization of treating a sinful individual as righteous; a vindication or defense. As eloquently stated by Hooker, this form of justification is external, acquired through imputation. This coincides with the concept of faith-based righteousness, where righteousness is ascribed due to another's actions rather than one's own deeds or obedience.
A query arises from Romans 4:5 regarding God’s justification of the ungodly and its implications for Universalism. This perplexity resolves upon examining the context of Paul's argument, which is predicated on the universal sinful nature of humanity. The focus here is justification by faith, not by works. This kind of justification is exclusively applicable to the ungodly; the righteous would not require it. As Jesus professed, His mission was not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance; the righteous have no need for repentance. However, the purpose or condition of this justification is crucial—it is not to condone ungodliness or save people in their sins, but rather to save them from their sins, to transform them into the righteousness of God in Christ. Matthew 1:21; 2 Corinthians 5:21.

Another contemplation emerges from verse 7 about the differentiation between righteousness and goodness. This distinction, often mistakenly attributed to obscure Jewish beliefs, is indeed substantive and frequently acknowledged. Dr. Clarke delineates four categories the Jews used to classify mankind. The just are those who fulfill their obligations to others; the good, those who demonstrate magnanimity or benevolence. The "young man" who approached Christ (Matthew 19:16-22) might have been just in this regard, but not benevolent. Scott interprets the just man as one of strict integrity, and the good as one of expansive philanthropy, essentially aligning with the aforementioned view. Chalmers describes the righteous or just man as merely innocent, while the good man is actively benevolent, echoing the same underlying theme.
