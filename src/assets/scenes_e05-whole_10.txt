Among various conjectures, the most convincing proposition is that the number arises from a title bestowed upon the Pope of Rome: Vicarius Filii Dei, meaning 'Vicar of the Son of God.' It is intriguing to observe that the Douay Bible, a version favoured by the Roman Catholic Church, comments on Revelation 13:18, stating that 'The numeral letters of his name shall make up this number.' Extracting the letters in the title that also serve as Roman numerals—V, 5; I, 1; C, 100; I, 1; U (anciently equivalent to V), 5; I, 1; L, 50; I, 1; I, 1; D, 500; I, 1—and aggregating them, we arrive precisely at the number 666.

The specific title Vicarius Filii Dei appears as early as 752-774 AD in a historically recognised document called the 'Donation of Constantine.' Despite later revelations proving that the document was not penned by Constantine the Great, but rather by an anonymous author seeking to lend it authenticity, this so-called Donation of Constantine was accepted as valid by at least nine popes over the course of seven centuries or more.

The Canon law of Gratian, translated by Christopher Coleman, reads: 'As the blessed Peter is seen to have been constituted Vicar of the Son of God on the earth, so the pontiffs who are the representatives of that same chief of the apostles, should obtain from us and our empire the power of a supremacy greater than the clemency of our earthly imperial serenity.' Edwin Lee Johnson, a professor of Latin and Greek at Vanderbilt University, offers a more liberal translation: 'Just as the Blessed Peter was appointed on earth vicar of the Son of God, so also it seems that the Pontiffs, his successors, hold on earth the power of the chief rule rather than (that) His Excellency, His Imperial Serene Highness on earth, (should hold it).' As Revelation 13 concludes, it leaves the faithful staring down the hostile forces of the world, their lives and societal standing threatened for their unwavering adherence to God's commandments.
