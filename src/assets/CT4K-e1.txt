God is like a big heart full of love. This means that He is always filled with love and cares for everyone, no matter what. Just like a heart keeps beating and never changes, God is always the same - He is always kind, loving, and never stops being good.

Think of everything around you, like trees, animals, and even stars - all of these are ways God shows us how much He loves us. His rule over everything means that He wants everyone and everything to be happy and full of joy. There's a big story about the fight between good and bad things, starting way up in heaven and going on until all the bad things go away forever. This big story helps us understand that God’s love is always there, and it never changes or goes away.

God didn't do all this alone. He had Jesus (who is also called the Word) to help Him. Jesus is God’s Son, and He's a lot like God. They're like best friends who plan everything together. Jesus was right there, helping God make all the amazing things in the universe, including all the angels in heaven.

God’s way of running everything is based on love. Imagine a big family where everyone gets along perfectly and is super happy - that's what it's like. God wants all of us, people, animals, and even stars, to live in a way that's right and good, which makes everyone happy. He wants us to love Him because we know He’s good, not because we have to. It's like choosing to play a game because it's fun, not because someone told you to. He gives us the freedom to choose to love and follow Him.

Remember, God is like a big, unchanging heart of love. He wants everything and everyone to be happy and to live in a way that’s full of love and goodness. This is the story of how God, with Jesus, made everything with love and continues to fill the world with love every day.
