Herein lies the apex of this awe-inspiring prophecy.
As Time continues its ceaseless march, bringing us ever closer to the magnificent scene foretold, we approach the culmination of human history. The kingdom of God – a splendid provision for a new and glorious era, in which His people shall find solace in the end of this world's melancholy, degenerate, and ever-changing journey. An exhilarating transformation for the righteous, from darkness to radiance, from discord to tranquility, from a sinful world to one of sanctity, from mortality to eternal life, and from oppression to the joyous liberty and divine privileges of a celestial kingdom! A wondrous metamorphosis, from frailty to fortitude, and from the fleeting and perishable to the everlasting and unchanging!
But when will this kingdom be established? Is it possible to know the answer to such a momentous inquiry that affects the destiny of humanity? The Word of God does not leave us in ignorance regarding these vital questions, thus revealing the extraordinary worth of this divine gift.

The Bible explicitly states that the kingdom of God was yet to come at the time of our Lord's final Passover (Matthew 26:29). Christ did not establish the kingdom before His ascension (Acts 1:6). Furthermore, it clarifies that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God (1 Corinthians 15:50). The kingdom is promised to the apostles and to all those who love God (James 2:5), to be granted in the future to the "little flock" (Luke 12:32). Through great tribulation, the saints shall enter the forthcoming kingdom (Acts 14:22). The kingdom will be established when Christ judges the living and the dead (2 Timothy 4:1), which will occur when He arrives in His glory with all His holy angels (Matthew 25:31-34).
We do not claim that the exact time of the kingdom's establishment is revealed (indeed, we emphasize that it is not) in this prophecy of Daniel 2 or any other prophecy. However, such a close approximation is provided that the generation destined to witness the establishment of this kingdom may discern its approach with certainty and make the necessary preparations to partake in all its splendors.
Time has fully manifested the great image in its entirety. It aptly represents the significant political events it was intended to symbolize. The image has stood complete for more than fourteen centuries, awaiting the moment when it will be struck upon its feet by the stone cut out of the mountain without hands – the kingdom of Christ. This event will transpire when the Lord is revealed in a blaze of fire, "taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ" (2 Thessalonians 1:8; see also Psalm 2:8-9). In the days of these kings, the God of heaven is to establish His kingdom. We have dwelt in the days of these kings for many centuries, and their days continue. As far as this prophecy is concerned, the very next event is the establishment of God's eternal kingdom. Other prophecies and countless signs indicate that the coming of Christ is imminent.
The early Christian church interpreted the prophecies of Daniel 2, 7, and 8 as we do now. Hippolytus, who lived between AD 160-236 and is believed to have been a disciple of Irenaeus, one of the four greatest theologians of his time, states in his exposition of Daniel 2 and Daniel 7:
"The golden head of the image and lioness denoted the Babylonians; the shoulders and arms of silver, and the bear, represented the Persians and Medes; the belly and thighs of brass, and the leopard, signified the Greeks, who held the sovereignty from Alexander's time; the legs of iron, and the beast dreadful and terrible, conveyed the Romans, who possess the sovereignty even now; the toes of the feet, composed of part clay and part iron, and the ten horns, symbolized the kingdoms that are yet to emerge; the small horn that sprouts among them represented the Antichrist within their midst; the stone that strikes the earth and brings judgment upon the world personified Christ."

The final act in the magnificent play of world events shall be the establishment of Christ's kingdom on Earth. "Speak with me, O blessed Daniel. Grant me full assurance, I implore thee. Thou prophesied concerning the lioness in Babylon; for thou were captive there. Thou unveiled the future regarding the bear; for thou were still in the world and witnessed these events come to pass. Then thou spoke of the leopard; and how couldst thou know this, for thou had already gone to thy rest? Who guided thee to proclaim these things, but He who formed thee in (from) thy mother's womb? That is God, thou said. Thou hast spoken indeed, and not falsely. The leopard has arisen; the he-goat has come; he hath shattered
his horns to pieces; he hath trampled upon him with his feet. He has been exalted by his downfall; (the) four horns have emerged from beneath that one. Rejoice, blessed Daniel! Thou hast not erred: all these things have come to pass.
"Following this, thou hast informed me of the dreadful and fearsome beast. 'It possessed iron teeth and claws of brass: it devoured and shattered, and trampled the remnants with its feet.' The iron reigns now; it already subdues and breaks all to pieces; it forces all the unwilling into submission; we now witness these events ourselves. Now we glorify God, being enlightened by thee." 
The portion of the prophecy fulfilled by that time was evident to the early Christians. They discerned that ten kingdoms would emerge from the Roman Empire, and that the Antichrist would manifest among them. They eagerly anticipated the grand finale, when the Second Coming of Christ would put an end to all earthly realms, and inaugurate the kingdom of righteousness.
The forthcoming kingdom! This subject should utterly captivate the present generation. Dear reader, are you prepared for the outcome? The one who enters this kingdom shall dwell within it, not merely for the duration of a mortal lifetime as experienced in the current state. They shall not witness its decline or its overthrow by a subsequent, more potent dominion. No, they shall enter to partake in all its privileges and blessings, and to revel in its splendors for eternity, for this kingdom shall not "be left to other people."
Once more, we inquire: Are you ready? The conditions of inheritance are most generous: "If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise." Galatians 3: 29. Are you in harmony with Christ, the imminent King? Do you cherish His character? Do you endeavor to tread humbly in His path and adhere to His teachings? If not, discern your destiny in the instances of those in the parable, of whom it was declared, "But those Mine enemies, who would not have Me reign over them, bring them here and slay them before Me." Luke 19: 27. No sanctuary can be found in a rival kingdom if you remain hostile to this one, for God's kingdom is to encompass all the territories ever held by any and all of the world's past or present kingdoms. It shall encompass the entire Earth. Fortunate are those to whom the rightful Sovereign, the all-victorious King, can ultimately say, "Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world." Matthew 25: 34.

We must now return to the regal abode of Nebuchadnezzar and to Daniel, as he stands before the sovereign. He has revealed to the monarch both the dream and its interpretation, while the courtiers and the confounded soothsayers and astrologers remain in hushed awe and wonder.
Nebuchadnezzar Elevates Daniel. In accordance with his promise of rewards, the king rendered Daniel a distinguished man. There exist two aspects in this life that are believed to render a man eminent, and both of these were conferred upon Daniel by the king: A man is deemed distinguished if he possesses wealth; and we learn that the king presented him with numerous and substantial gifts. If, alongside affluence, a man has authority, he is undoubtedly esteemed a great man in the eyes of society; and power was granted to Daniel in ample measure. He was appointed as the ruler over the province of Babylon and the chief of the governors presiding over all the wise men of Babylon. Thus swiftly and generously was Daniel rewarded for his loyalty to his conscience and the mandates of God.
Daniel did not become disoriented or overwhelmed by his remarkable triumph and extraordinary elevation. He initially remembered the three individuals who shared his concerns regarding the king's matter. As they had supported him with their prayers, he resolved that they should partake in his honors. At his behest, they were assigned positions of authority over the affairs of Babylon, while Daniel himself occupied a seat at the king's gate. The gate was the site where councils convened and where matters of utmost importance were deliberated. This account is a modest proclamation that Daniel became the principal advisor to the king.

As we conclude our exploration of the remarkable prophecies in Daniel chapter 2, we are left with a sense of awe and wonder at the accuracy and foresight of these ancient revelations. Through the interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's dream, we have been provided with a sweeping overview of world history and an unshakable assurance in the divine plan.

In our next episode, we will dive into the fascinating and symbolic world of Daniel chapter 7.
