The sea is emblematic of 'peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues' (Revelation 17:15). In the Bible, a beast often symbolizes a nation or power, sometimes representing civil power alone, and at other times representing ecclesiastical power in connection with civil power. When a beast arises out of the sea, it signifies the emergence of a power in a densely populated region. If winds blow upon the sea, as portrayed in Daniel 7:2, 3, this implies political turmoil, civil strife, and revolution.
The dragon from the preceding chapter and the beast introduced in this chapter represent the Roman power in its two phases, pagan and papal. Thus, both these symbols possess seven heads and ten horns (see comments on Revelation 17:10). The seven-headed and ten-horned beast, or the leopard beast, symbolizes a power that exercises both ecclesiastical and civil authority. This notion is crucial and warrants the presentation of several compelling arguments to substantiate it.
The prophetic line that contains this symbol commences with Revelation 12. The symbols of earthly governments encompassed within the prophecy include the dragon of Revelation 12 and the leopard beast and the two-horned beast of Revelation 13. This prophetic line evidently extends into chapter 14. Therefore, from Revelation 12:1 to Revelation 14:5, a distinct and complete prophetic line is presented.
Each of the powers introduced here is depicted as ferociously persecuting the church of God. The scene unfolds with the church, symbolized as a woman, eagerly awaiting the fulfillment of the promise that the seed of the woman, the Lord of glory, would appear among humankind. The dragon stands before the woman, intending to devour her child. However, its sinister intent is foiled, and the child is caught up to God and His throne. A period follows in which the church endures severe oppression at the hands of the dragon power. The prophet occasionally looks ahead during this segment of the scene, even to nearly the end, as all of the church's enemies would be driven by the spirit of the dragon. In Revelation 13:1, we are brought back to the inception of the leopard beast, the dragon's successor, and its career. The church suffers war and persecution for an extended period of 1260 years under this power. Following this era of oppression, the church experiences another brief yet intense conflict with the two-horned beast. Subsequently, deliverance arrives. The prophecy concludes with the church triumphant, standing with the Lamb on Mount Zion, having successfully overcome all persecution.
Throughout these scenes, the constant character, whose history serves as the primary theme in the prophecy, is the true Church of God. The other characters are the church's persecutors, introduced solely because of their roles as such. In this context, we pose the question: Who or what persecutes the true church? The answer is a false or apostate church. The perpetual enemy of true religion is a counterfeit and false religion. It is unheard of for the mere civil power of any nation to persecute God's people independently. Governments may wage war against other governments to avenge a perceived or genuine wrong, to acquire territory, or to extend their power. However, governments do not persecute (note the word 'do not persecute') people based on their religion unless they are under the control of an opposing and hostile religious system.
The powers introduced in this prophecy—the dragon, the leopard beast, and the two-horned beast of verses 11-17—are all persecuting powers, driven by rage and enmity against God's people and church. This fact alone is compelling enough evidence to conclude that each of these powers is governed by an ecclesiastical or religious element.
Consider the dragon: what does it symbolize? The indisputable response is that it primarily represents Satan, as previously demonstrated, and secondarily the Roman Empire. However, this is insufficient. No one would be satisfied with this answer alone. It must be more specific. Therefore, we assert that it represents the Roman Empire in its pagan form, a notion with which all must concur. As soon as we mention paganism, we introduce a religious element, for paganism is one of the most colossal systems of counterfeit religion that Satan has ever devised. Hence, the dragon is an ecclesiastical power to the extent that the very characteristic that defines it is a false system of religion. What prompted the dragon to persecute the church of Christ? It was the growing influence of Christianity against paganism, eradicating its superstitions, toppling its idols, and dismantling its temples. The religious element of that power was affected, and persecution ensued.


We now examine the leopard beast of Revelation 13. What does it symbolize? The response remains the Roman Empire. However, the dragon also symbolized the Roman Empire, so why does the same symbol not continue to represent it? The answer lies in the change in the religious character of the empire. This beast symbolizes Rome in its ostensibly Christian form. It is this transformation in religion, and this alone, that necessitates a change in the symbol. This beast only differs from the dragon in that it presents a distinct religious aspect. Consequently, it would be incorrect to assert that it denotes merely the Roman civil power.
A Symbol of the Papacy. The dragon bequeaths to this beast his power, his seat, and great authority. Which power succeeded pagan Rome? We are all aware that it was papal Rome. It is of no consequence to our present objective when or how this change transpired. The significant fact is evident and universally acknowledged: the next prominent phase of the Roman Empire after its pagan form was its papal incarnation. Therefore, it would be improper to claim that pagan Rome transferred its power and seat to a purely civil form of government, devoid of any religious element. Such a notion strains the imagination. Only two phases of empire are recognized here, and in the prophecy, Rome is pagan until Rome becomes papal. The assertion that the dragon gives his power and seat to the leopard beast serves as additional evidence that the dragon of Revelation 12:3 symbolizes pagan Rome. Behind both powers, however, Satan himself lurks, guiding them in their malevolent deeds.
It may be argued that the leopard beast and the two-horned beast together constitute the papacy, and thus it is to these that the dragon bestows his power, seat, and great authority. However, the prophecy does not support this notion. The leopard beast alone interacts with the dragon. It alone receives the dragon's power, seat, and great authority. This beast possesses a head that suffers a mortal wound but subsequently heals. The entire world marvels at this beast, which boasts a mouth uttering blasphemies and persecutes the saints for 1260 years. All of this occurs before the emergence of the subsequent power, the two-horned beast. Therefore, the leopard beast alone symbolizes the Roman Empire in its papal form, with the ecclesiastical influence reigning supreme.
Identical with the Little Horn. To further elucidate this point, we need only draw a parallel between the little horn of Daniel 7:8, 20, 24, 25, and this power. This comparison reveals that the little horn and the leopard beast represent the same power. The little horn is widely acknowledged as a symbol of the papacy. There are six points by which to establish their identity:
The little horn was a blasphemous power: 'He shall speak great words against the Most High.' (Daniel 7:25) The leopard beast of Revelation 13:6 follows suit: 'He opened his mouth in blasphemy against God.'
The little horn waged war with the saints and prevailed against them (Daniel 7:21). Similarly, this beast (Revelation 13:7) makes war with the saints and overcomes them.
The little horn possessed a mouth that spoke great things (Daniel 7:8, 20). Regarding this beast, we read: 'There was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies.' (Revelation 13:5)
The little horn emerged upon the cessation of the pagan form of the Roman Empire. The beast of Revelation 13:2 arises at the same time, for the dragon, pagan Rome, bestows upon him his power, his seat , and great authority.
5. The little horn was granted power to endure for a time, times, and the dividing of time, or 1260 years (Daniel 7:25). This beast also receives power for forty-two months or 1260 years (Revelation 13:5).
At the end of the specified 1260-year period, the 'saints,' 'times,' and 'laws' were to be liberated from the 'hand' of the little horn (Daniel 7:25). Simultaneously, at the conclusion of the same period, the leopard beast was to be led 'into captivity' (Revelation 13:10). Both of these stipulations were fulfilled in the captivity and exile of the pope, as well as the temporary overthrow of the papacy by France in 1798.

These six points compellingly establish the identity of the little horn and the leopard beast. When two symbols in prophecy, as in this case, represent powers that emerge concurrently, occupy the same territory, embody the same characteristics, perform the same deeds, persist for the same duration, and confront the same fate, those symbols signify the same identical power.
The Deadly Wound Received. The head that suffered a deadly wound was the papal head. This conclusion is grounded in the evident principle that whatever is stated in prophecy about the symbol of any government pertains solely to that government while it is depicted by that symbol. Rome is represented by two symbols, the dragon and the leopard beast, as it has exhibited two phases: pagan and papal. Consequently, whatever is said of the leopard beast applies to Rome only in its ostensibly Christian form. John asserts that one of the heads of this leopard beast was wounded to death. In other words, this wound struck the form of government that persisted in the Roman Empire after its transition from paganism to Christianity. Hence, it is clear that it was the papal head that sustained the deadly wound, which was subsequently healed. This wounding is identical to the descent into captivity (Revelation 13:10) and occurred when Pope Pius VI was taken prisoner by Berthier, the French general, and the papal government was temporarily abolished in 1798. Deprived of his power, both civil and ecclesiastical, the captive Pope Pius VI passed away in exile in Valence, France, on August 29, 1799. However, the deadly wound commenced its healing when the papacy was reestablished, albeit with diminished power, through the election of a new pope on March 14, 1800.



The Act of Speaking Blasphemies. This beast opens its mouth 'in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, and His tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.' Earlier commentary on the book of Daniel touched upon the meaning of the phrase 'He shall speak great words against the Most High' (Daniel 7:25). Verse 5 of this Revelation chapter employs similar language, as the beast is described as having 'a mouth speaking great things.' However, the addition of the word 'blasphemy' seemingly highlights the notion that these grand utterances will be blasphemous declarations against the God of heaven.
The Gospels offer two examples of what constitutes blasphemy. In John 10:33, the Jews falsely accused Jesus of blasphemy, asserting, 'Thou, being a man, makest Thyself God.' This charge was baseless in the case of the Savior, as He was the Son of God – 'Immanuel, God With Us.' For a mere mortal to assume divine prerogatives and adopt deity titles would indeed constitute blasphemy. In another instance, Luke 5:21 depicts the Pharisees attempting to ensnare Jesus with His own words. They asked, 'Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?' Jesus, as the divine Savior, possessed the authority to absolve transgressions. However, for a mortal human to claim such power would be undeniably blasphemous.
It is worth questioning whether the power symbolized by this beast has fulfilled this aspect of the prophecy. In the commentary on Daniel 7:25, evidence clearly demonstrated that this power had spoken 'great words' against the God of heaven. The priesthood's claim to absolve sins is also revealed: 'The priest holds the place of the Savior Himself when, by saying, 'Ego te absolvo' [I thee absolve], he absolves from sin. ... To pardon a single sin requires all the omnipotence of God. But what only God can do by His omnipotence, the priest can also do by saying 'Ego te absolvo a peccatis tuis.' Innocent III has written: 'Indeed, it is not too much to say that in view of the sublimity of their offices the priests are so many gods.''
Further blasphemous proclamations of this power can be observed:
'But our wonder should be far greater when we find that in obedience to the words of His priests HOC EST CORPUS MEUM [This is My body], God Himself descends on the altar, that He comes wherever they call Him, and as often as they call Him, and places Himself in their hands, even though they should be His enemies. And after having come, He remains, entirely at their disposal; they move Him as they please, from one place to another; they may, if they wish, shut Him up in the tabernacle, or expose Him on the altar, or carry Him outside the church; they may, if they choose, eat His flesh, and give Him for the food of others. 'Oh, how very great is their power,' says St. Laurence Justinian, speaking of priests. 'A word falls from their lips and the body of Christ is there substantially formed from the matter of bread, and the Incarnate Word descended from heaven is found really present on the table of the altar!''
'Thus the priest may, in a certain manner, be called the creator of his Creator. 'The power of the priest,' says St. Bernardine of Sienna, 'is the power of the divine person; for the transubstantiation of the bread requires as much power as the creation of the world.''
Hence, this beastly power blasphemes the heavenly temple by directing the focus of its followers to its own throne and palace, rather than to the tabernacle of God. It diverts their attention from the sacrifice of the Son of God to the sacrifice of the Mass. It further blasphemes those dwelling in heaven by presuming to wield the authority to forgive sins, thereby diverting the minds of people from Christ's mediatorial work and the role of His celestial assistants in the heavenly sanctuary.
Verse 10 alludes once more to the events of 1798, when the power that had held the saints of God captive for 1260 years was itself led into captivity.
 

The Two-Horned Beast. This verse introduces the third significant symbol in the prophetic line under examination, commonly referred to as the two-horned beast. We seek its application. The dragon, representing pagan Rome, and the leopard beast, symbolizing papal Rome, portray two prominent organizations representing two vast systems of false religion. By analogy, it seems fitting that the remaining symbol, the two-horned beast, should similarly apply and find its fulfillment in a nation embodying yet another substantial system of religion. The only remaining system exerting a controlling influence in the world today is Protestantism. Considered abstractly, paganism encompasses all heathen lands, containing more than half the global population. Catholicism, potentially including the religion of the Greek Orthodox Church, which is nearly identical, belongs to nations comprising a significant portion of Christendom. A vivid depiction of Mohammedanism and its impact has been provided in other prophecies (see commentary on Daniel 11 and Revelation 9). However, Protestantism is the religion of nations that constitute the vanguard of liberty, enlightenment, progress, and power.
Symbol of America. If, then, Protestantism is the religion to which we must turn our attention, to which nation, as its representative, does the prophecy pertain? There are noteworthy Protestant nations in Europe, but for reasons that will become apparent, the symbol cannot apply to any of these. A thorough investigation has led to the conclusion that it applies to Protestant America or the United States of America. The rationale for such an application and the evidence supporting it will be carefully examined.
Are there any reasons to anticipate the United States being mentioned in prophecy? On what grounds have other nations found a place in the prophetic record? Firstly, they have played a prominent role in world history; and secondly, and most importantly, they have held jurisdiction over or maintained significant relations with the people of God. From the records of the Bible and secular history, we can deduce this rule concerning the prophetic mention of earthly governments: a nation enters prophecy when its work and destiny become definitively intertwined with God's people. All these conditions are undoubtedly met in the United States. The belief has taken hold of many that the rise and progress of this nation have been such that Providence deemed it fitting to foreshadow in prophecy.
In 1780, during the American Revolution, English statesman Governor Pownal predicted that this country would achieve independence, be animated by a civilizing energy surpassing that of Europe, and that its commercial and naval power would reach every corner of the globe. He then referred to the probable establishment of this country as a free and sovereign power as ''a revolution that has stranger marks of divine interposition, superseding the ordinary course of human affairs, than any other event which this world has experienced.''
George Alfred Townsend, commenting on the misfortunes plaguing other governments in the Western Hemisphere, remarked, 'The history of the United States was separated by a beneficent Providence far from this wild and cruel history of the rest of the continent.'
Such considerations are likely to instill in every mind a strong anticipation that this nation will have a role to play in the execution of God's providential purposes in this world, and that it will be mentioned somewhere in the prophetic word.
Chronology of This Power. In which period of the world's history does the prophecy place the rise of this power? The foundation for the conclusions we must reach is already established in the facts presented concerning the leopard beast. It was when this beast went into captivity, or was killed with the sword (verse 10), or had one of its heads wounded to death (verse 3), that John witnessed the two-horned beast emerging. If the leopard beast, as we have conclusively demonstrated, symbolizes the papacy, and its captivity corresponds to the temporary overthrow of the papacy by the French in 1798, then we have the time precisely specified when we are to look for the rise of this power. The expression 'coming up' must indicate that the power to which it applies was just newly organized, and was then beginning to ascend to prominence and influence.


Can anyone question which nation was genuinely 'coming up' in 1798? Undoubtedly, the United States of America is the sole power that fulfills the prophecy's specifications at this point in time.
The American colonies' fight for independence commenced in 1775. In 1776, they declared themselves a free and independent nation. In 1777, delegates from the thirteen original States—New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia—in Congress assembled, adopted the Articles of Confederation. In 1783, the War of the Revolution concluded with a treaty of peace with Great Britain, recognizing the independence of the United States and ceding a territory of 815,615 square miles. In 1787, the Constitution was drafted, and by July 26, 1788, it was ratified by eleven of the thirteen original States; it went into effect on March 1, 1789. Thus, the United States began with less than one million square miles of territory and fewer than four million citizens. This brings us to 1798 when this nation enters the realm of prophecy. John Wesley, in his notes on Revelation 13, written in 1754, says of the two-horned beast:
'He has not yet come, though he cannot be far off. For he is to appear at the end of the forty-two months of the first beast.'
The Age of This Power. The prophecy provides substantial evidence that the government symbolized by the two-horned beast is introduced during the early stages of its existence, signifying that it is a youthful power. John writes, 'I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb.' Why does John not simply state, 'He had two horns'? Why does he add 'like a lamb'? It must be to denote the character of this beast, demonstrating that it is not only innocent and harmless in demeanor but also a youthful power, for the horns of a lamb are horns that have just begun to grow.
Remember that by the preceding argument on chronology, our attention is focused on the year 1798 when the power symbolized was youthful. What significant power was at that time emerging but still in its infancy? England was not, nor was France, nor Russia, nor any European power. To find a young and rising power at that epoch, we must turn our eyes to the New World. As soon as we do so, they inevitably rest upon the United States as the power in question. No other power west of the Atlantic Ocean fits the description.
The Location of the Two-Horned Beast. A single declaration of the prophecy is sufficient to guide us to important and accurate conclusions on this matter. John refers to it as 'another beast,' meaning it is not part of the first beast, and the power it symbolizes is likewise not part of that represented by the first beast. This refutes the claim of those who avoid the symbol's application to the United States by arguing that it denotes some aspect of the papacy; in such a case, it would be part of the preceding, or leopard, beast.
Since this is 'another' beast, 'coming up out of the earth,' it must be found in a territory not covered by any other symbols. Babylon and Medo-Persia encompassed all the civilized parts of Asia. Greece covered Eastern Europe, including Russia. Rome, along with the ten kingdoms into which it was divided, as represented by the ten toes of the image in Daniel 2, the ten horns of the fourth beast in Daniel 7, the ten horns of the dragon in Revelation 12, and 
the ten horns of the leopard beast in Revelation 13, covered all of Western Europe. In other words, the entire Eastern Hemisphere, known to history and civilization, is encompassed by prophetic symbols concerning which there is scarcely any room for doubt.
However, there exists a powerful nation in the Western Hemisphere, worthy, as we have seen, of mention in prophecy, which has not yet been addressed. There remains one symbol whose application has not yet been made. All symbols but one are applied, and all the available regions of the Eastern Hemisphere are covered by the applications. Among all the symbols mentioned, only one remains, the two-horned beast of Revelation 13. Regarding all the countries on Earth for which any reason exists as to why they should be mentioned in prophecy, only one remains, the United States of America. Does the two-horned beast represent the United States? If it does, then all the symbols find an application, and all the ground is covered. If it does not, it follows that the United States is not represented in prophecy, and the symbol of the two-horned beast is left without a nation to which it can apply. However, the first of these suppositions is not probable, and the second is not possible.


Another aspect directing us to the location of this power originates from the observation that John saw it rise from the earth. If the sea, from which the leopard beast emerged (Revelation 13:1), signifies peoples, nations, and multitudes (Revelation 17:15), the earth, by contrast, would imply a new and previously unoccupied territory. By excluding Eastern continents and considering territory not previously known to civilization, we inevitably turn our attention to the Western Hemisphere.
The manner in which the two-horned beast appears aligns seamlessly with its location, age, and chronology, further corroborating that it symbolizes the United States. John observed the beast emerging 'out of the earth.' This phrase was intentionally employed to highlight the contrast between the rise of this beast and that of other national prophetic symbols. The four beasts of Daniel 7 and the leopard beast of Revelation 13 all arose from the sea. New nations typically rise by overthrowing existing nations and assuming their position. However, no nation was overthrown to make way for the United States, and its attainment of independence was already a 15-year-old achievement when it entered the realm of prophecy. The prophet witnessed only peace.
The word used in verse 11 to describe the manner in which this beast arises, anabainon, can prominently be defined as 'to grow or spring up as a plant.' It is a striking fact that this same metaphor has been selected by political writers, independent of any reference to the prophecy, as the most fitting representation of the manner in which the United States has emerged. George Alfred Townsend states:
'In this web of islands, the West Indies, began the life of both [North and South] Americas. There Columbus saw land; there Spain began her baneful and brilliant Western empire; thence Cortez departed for Mexico, De Soto for the Mississippi, Balboa for the Pacific, and Pizarro for Peru. The history of the United States was separated by a beneficent Providence far from this wild and cruel history of the rest of the continent, and like a silent seed we grew into empire; while empire itself, beginning in the South, was swept by so interminable hurricane that what of its history we can ascertain is read by the very lightnings that devastated it. The growth of English America may be likened to a series of lyrics sung by separate singers, which, coalescing, at last make a vigorous chorus, and this, attracting many from afar, swells and is prolonged, until presently it assumes the dignity and proportions of epic song.' 
A writer in the Dublin Nation described the United States as a remarkable empire that was 'emerging' and 'amid the silence of the earth daily adding to its power and pride.'
Edward Everett, in an oration on the English exiles who founded this government, expressed:
'Did they look for a retired spot, inoffensive for its obscurity, and safe in its remoteness, where the little church of Leyden might enjoy the freedom of conscience? Behold the mighty regions over which, in peaceful conquest victoria sine clade [victory without strife] they have borne the banners of the cross.' Observe these expressions side by side: 'coming up out of the earth,' 'emerging amid the silence of the earth,' 'like a silent seed we grew into empire,' 'mighty regions' secured by 'peaceful conquest.' The first originates from the prophet, stating what would transpire when the two-horned beast arose; the others come from political writers, recounting the history of the United States of America. Can anyone fail to discern that the latter three are precisely synonymous with the first and that they document a complete fulfillment of the prediction ?
Another crucial question follows: Has the United States 'risen' in a manner that aligns with the specifications of the prophecy? Let us examine this further. A brief period before the great Reformation in the days of Martin Luther, over four centuries ago, this Western Hemisphere was discovered. The Reformation awakened nations, bound by the oppressive chains of superstition and tyranny, to the profound truth that every individual possesses the divine right to worship God according to their own conscience. However, rulers are often reluctant to relinquish their power, and religious intolerance persisted in oppressing the people. Under these circumstances, a group of courageous believers ultimately resolved to seek the civil and religious freedom they so ardently desired in the untamed lands of America. To accomplish their noble objective, one hundred of these voluntary exiles disembarked from the 'Mayflower' on the coast of New England on December 21, 1620. As Martyn remarks, 'New England was born' in that moment, and its 'first baby cry' was a prayer and a thanksgiving to the Lord.'


Another lasting English settlement was established at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. As time progressed, additional settlements were founded and colonies organized, all of which remained under the English crown until the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776.
The population of these colonies grew from 262,000 in 1701 to 1,046,000 in 1749 and reached 2,803,000 by 1775.  Following the struggle for independence, a united constitutional government was established, declaring to the world that here all could find refuge from oppression and intolerance. Immigrants from the Old World arrived in their thousands, contributing to the population and prosperity of the new nation through peaceful means. Large territories were either purchased or acquired through treaties to accommodate the growing number of settlers. Fast forward more than 150 years to the second quarter of the twentieth century: the United States' territory has expanded to over three and a half million square miles, and its population has surpassed 135,000,000 people.
The United States' astonishing growth in material prosperity and intellectual development has left the world in awe and offers an ample foundation for the application of the prophecy.
In examining the character of its government as symbolized, further evidence arises that the symbol represents the United States. John describes this power as having 'two horns like a lamb.' The lamb's horns denote youthfulness, innocence, and gentleness. The United States, a recently emerged power, aligns perfectly with the symbol in terms of age, while no other power does. Considering the horns as an indicator of power and character, one can identify the two horns of the government by determining the source of its power and the essence of its outward profession. The Hon. J.A. Bingham offers insight into the matter, stating that the initial settlers aimed to establish 'what the world had not seen for ages; viz., a church without a pope, and a state without a king.' In other words, a government where ecclesiastical power is separate from civil power, with civil and religious liberty as defining characteristics.
There is no need to argue that this is indeed the American government's profession. Article IV, Section 4, of the United States Constitution partially reads: 'The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a republican form of government.' Article VI asserts: 'No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.' The First Amendment to the Constitution commences with: 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.' These articles pledge the broadest guarantee of civil and religious liberty, ensuring the eternal separation of church and state. What more fitting symbols could be presented than 'two horns like a lamb'? In which other nation can a situation so perfectly embodying this aspect of the symbol be found?
The two-horned beast, notably lacking crowns on its horns, symbolizes a nation with a republican form of government. A crown is a fitting symbol of a monarchical or dictatorial government, while the absence of crowns, as in this instance, implies a government where power is not concentrated in any such ruling individual, but rather lies in the people's hands.
However, this is not the most definitive proof that the nation symbolized here has a republican form of government. Verse 14 reveals that the people are appealed to when any national action is required: 'Saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast.' This is particularly true in the United States. As previously demonstrated, the Constitution guarantees 'a republican form of government.' This additional evidence strengthens the argument that this symbol applies to the United States of America. No other government could reasonably be thought 
of as fitting this symbol.
The two-horned beast, devoid of crowns on its horns, represents a nation embracing a republican form of government. In such a system, power is not held by a ruling individual, but rather is vested in the hands of the people.
However, the most compelling evidence that the nation symbolized here possesses a republican government lies in verse 14, which reveals that the people are consulted when any national action is to be undertaken: 'Saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast.' This is especially true in the United States, where the Constitution guarantees 'a republican form of government,' as previously demonstrated. This additional evidence further solidifies the argument that this symbol is applicable to the United States of America. It is challenging to conceive of any other government to which this symbol could be more appropriately applied.

The emblematic creature of the two horns represents a nation that inherently cannot embrace Catholicism. The essence of the papacy is a fusion of church and state, a concept starkly at odds with the Constitution of the United States of America. As stated in Article VI, 'no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust', thereby eternally separating religious and state powers. The principles of civil and religious liberty lie at the heart of Protestantism. The founding fathers of this vast nation, having lived in close proximity to the events resulting from the amalgamation of church and state, were fiercely protective of the liberties they espoused as the inherent rights of all. They were swift to denounce any hint of church-state union. From a religious perspective, the United States emerges as a Protestant nation, aligning seamlessly with the prophecy's requisites. The prophecy, thus, unmistakably alludes to this nation.
Before we delve into another facet of this prophetic symbol, let us recapitulate the aspects thus far established:
The power symbolized by the two-horned beast represents a nation distinct from the Old World's powers. This nation must emerge in the Western Hemisphere, gaining prominence and influence around the year 1798. It must rise peacefully and subtly, augmenting its power and expanding its territories without resorting to bellicose expansion or conquest. Its progress must be as visibly striking as the palpable growth of an animal. This nation must adopt a republican form of government and a Protestant religion. It must demonstrate to the world two fundamentally just, innocent, and lamb-like principles that underpin its governance. It must accomplish its work post-1798.
As we examine the United States' history, we find all these specifications conclusively met. No other nation's history satisfies these conditions. Thus, it is impossible to apply Revelation 13:11's symbol to any other nation except the United States of America.
The prophecy foretells that the United States, represented by the two-horned beast, will eventually 'speak as a dragon.' This implies a shift from its lamb-like nature to a draconian one, echoing the actions of the dragon before it. It is with a heavy heart that we anticipate such a peaceful nation, founded on noble governing principles, transforming into a draconian power and persecuting God's people. Yet, we must adhere to the divinely inspired prophecy.
Given that the United States is the power symbolized by the entity that 'speaks as a dragon,' it follows that this nation will enact unjust and oppressive laws against its citizens' religious beliefs and practices, thereby becoming a persecuting power.


The Exertion of Persecutory Authority. This nation, having spoken as a dragon, is further declared to 'exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him.' Recalling previous verses, we identify the 'first beast before him' as the leopard - a symbol of the papacy. This leads us to a startling inference: a nation, initially embodying Protestant ideals, will come to wield the papacy's persecutory power, thereby becoming a pseudo-Protestant entity, or the 'false prophet' as mentioned in Revelation 19:20, further elucidated in the subsequent section.
The wielding of this power manifests in compelling the denizens within its jurisdiction to 'worship the first beast,' the papacy. The Greek term for 'worship' employed here carries profound implications. Deriving from the simple verb, kuneo, 'I kiss,' but further nuanced with a preposition indicating the kiss is directed towards someone - in this case, the papacy or the Pope. It typically translates to 'do obeisance to, bow down to,' and the Septuagint uses it in Nebuchadnezzar's decree to all 'people, nations, and languages' to 'fall down and worship the golden image' erected in the plain of Dura, as mentioned in Daniel 3: 4, 5. Such 'worship' implies submission to the authority and edicts of the entity receiving the obeisance. This submission to the papacy by a nation professedly Protestant is the vivid portrait painted in the prophecy.


'He Doeth Great Wonders.' Further exploration of the prophecy involving the two-horned beast reveals the statement, 'he does great wonders so that he makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men.' This aligns convincingly with the United States, portrayed by the two-horned beast. None would deny that we currently reside in an era teeming with wonders. We invite the reader to peruse our discourse on Daniel 12: 4 for a deeper appreciation of the marvels of our age, including the unparalleled strides in science and technology.
However, the prophecy's fulfillment extends beyond the advancements in knowledge, discoveries, and inventions that dominate our times. The wonders that captivated the prophet's attention seem deliberately designed to beguile the populace. As stated in verse 14: 'Deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast.'
We should strive to comprehend how these miracles transpire, as Revelation 16: 13, 14 alludes to 'the spirits of devils working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world.'
Predicting the events preceding His Second Coming, Jesus warns: 'There shall arise false christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.' Matthew 24: 24. Here again, we encounter a prophecy of deceitful wonders so potent that they could potentially beguile even the very elect.
Hence, we encounter a prophecy - one among many - that forecasts the emergence of a wonder-working power in the last days, exploiting astonishing and unprecedented phenomena to disseminate falsehood and error. While the 'spirits of devils' would spread to 'the whole world,' the prophecy in Revelation 13 particularly associates this development with the nation represented by the two-horned beast or false prophet - America. Thus, we must infer that this deceptive work will emerge within America. Is there evidence of such a phenomenon currently?
A prevalent belief pervades society that when a man dies, an immortal 'spirit' or 'soul' survives, departing the earthly remains to ascend to a place of reward or punishment. This belief naturally incites the question: 'If disembodied spirits persist, could they not communicate with us?' Countless individuals claim such communication with departed loved ones.
Yet, the Bible unequivocally asserts that the dead remain inactive and unconscious until the resurrection; that they are devoid of knowledge (Ecclesiastes 9: 5), mental function (Psalm 146: 4), and emotional capacity (Ecclesiastes 9: 6); and that there is neither work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave where they rest (Ecclesiastes 9: 10). Therefore, any entity claiming to be a deceased individual is contradicting the Word of God. As David declares in 2 Samuel 12: 23 concerning his deceased child, 'Now he is dead, . . . I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.' Such an entity cannot be a divine angel, as God's angels do not deceive. However, spirits of devils do deceive, as evidenced by their leader's first lie in Eden, 'Ye shall not surely die,' when God had explicitly told Adam, 'Thou shall surely die.' Genesis 3: 4; 2: 17.
The Birthplace of Spiritism. Modern spiritism also aligns with the prophecy, as it originated in the United States, linking its wonders with the work of the two-horned beast. Emerging in Hydesville, New York, within the household of John D. Fox in late March of 1848, spiritism began to proliferate with an astonishing velocity, ultimately reaching the far corners of the world.
These alleged revelations incited significant curiosity, leading to an array of renowned individuals endeavoring to investigate this 'rapping delusion,' as it was colloquially termed. From that moment forth, spiritism persisted as an influential force within the modern world, a force that has continued to expand steadily. It is challenging to ascertain the number of its adherents, given that many who subscribe to its teachings identify with no specific denomination, while others maintain their affiliation with non-spiritist denominations despite engaging in communication with the deceased. Nonetheless, it is estimated that North America alone boasts 16,000,000 spiritists at the beginning of the 20th century. Including those religions across the world where spiritism plays a significant role, the number swells to astounding hundreds of millions.
Thus, the prophecy's implications and the contemporary emergence of spiritism within the United States seem remarkably intertwined. This connection further solidifies the identification of the United States as the power symbolized by the two-horned beast, performing great wonders that bewitch the inhabitants of the earth, even in the sight of the beast.

Several years ago, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle articulated a vision: 'The humble manifestations of Hydesville have matured into phenomena that have drawn the attention of the most brilliant intellects of our nation for the past two decades. In my view, they are destined to spark the most considerable evolution of human experience that the world has ever encountered.' 'If such a perspective of Christianity gained widespread acceptance, reinforced by the assurances and demonstrations from the New Revelation that, in my belief, is reaching us from beyond, we could cultivate a creed capable of uniting the churches, harmonizing with science, withstanding all assaults, and perpetuating the Christian faith indefinitely.'
Spiritism's Teachings. Yet, the tenets propagated by spiritism are starkly discordant with God's Word. Their stance towards the Bible is encapsulated in the subsequent excerpt: 'We do not wish to obfuscate the stark reality that there is much in certain sections of the Bible that does not coalesce with our teachings—indeed, these are human errors that seeped into the consciousness of the selected medium.' 'None of the books, as they currently exist, are the original work of their attributed authors. They are the assemblage of Ezra and his scribes and merely encapsulate the conceptions and legends of their era. We highlight this to preemptively dismiss any necessity to respond to texts from these books that may be invoked as an argument.' 
Regarding spiritists' relationship with Christ and His atoning sacrifice, consider the following profound comment: 'They [the spirits] assert that Jesus Christ bears no relevance to the matters of life and death, and they are ignorant of the 'mediation of our Savior Jesus Christ.'' Spiritism's adherents also dismiss the notion of the second coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ: 'Jesus Christ is currently orchestrating His plans for the gathering of His people, for the further revelation of truth, as well as for the eradication of the erroneous beliefs accrued over time. I have heard whispers of this from other sources. Is this then the return of Christ? It is the spiritual return. There will be no physical return as mankind has fantasized. This will be a return to His people through the voice of His messengers speaking to those who have open ears.'
Spiritism's Phenomena. How poignant these words are! Centuries ago, the prophet of Patmos proclaimed that power would emerge in this nation that 'does great wonders,' and, indeed, spiritism has surfaced purporting to perform these exact feats. Spiritism aligns impeccably with the prophecy through its display of magnificent signs and wonders. Noteworthy among its feats are the following: Spirits have relocated various objects from one location to another. Enchanting music has emanated, independent of human involvement, both with and without the use of visible instruments. Numerous instances of healing have been documented. Spectators have witnessed individuals being levitated by spirits. Tables, with several people atop them, have been suspended in mid-air. Spirits have even materialized in physical form and communicated with audible voices.
The power prophesied is foretold to 'make fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men.' However, these and other demonstrations of its power are designed to beguile 'them that dwell on the earth.' The miracles performed are attributed to 'the spirits of devils.' Revelation 16:14. The Word of God is replete with admonitions against interacting with malevolent spirits. In the era of the early church, grave warnings were dispensed to the congregation of God: 'Now the Spirit speaks explicitly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seductive spirits, and doctrines of demons.' 1 Timothy 4:1. God's counsel to His people in these final days resonates with a distinct urgency: 'When they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? For the living to the dead? To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.' Isaiah 8:19, 20.
This power, foretold to orchestrate 'great wonders,' manifests itself not only in the grandeur of its supernatural performances but also in the subtlety of its deception. It employs these marvels, not to inspire awe or encourage faith, but to beguile and ensnare. The true nature of these miracles is exposed in Revelation 16:14, where they are revealed as the workings of 'the spirits of devils.' The Scriptures abound with solemn admonitions against consorting with such malevolent spirits, stark warnings that echo through the ages, from the early church to the final days of prophecy.
The counsel of God to His people is explicit: to reject the lure of those who claim communion with the dead, to resist the whispers of wizards that mutter in shadows. The living should seek their God, for the dead have no light to offer. The Word of God is the beacon that illuminates the path of righteousness, and those who stray from it wander into darkness. Those who do not speak according to this Word bear witness to their own ignorance, for 'there is no light in them.' Isaiah 8:19, 20.

In our modern age, the prophecy of the two-horned beast has materialized with disturbing precision, its wonders captivating minds and its falsehoods blurring the line between truth and deception. Yet, the Scriptures provide a clear and unequivocal directive, a clarion call to discernment and faithfulness in the face of such seductive deceit. 'To the law and to the testimony,' we are commanded, a testament to the enduring power of God's Word in an age of wonders and illusions.

Inextricably linked to these miraculous performances is the creation of an image dedicated to the beast. The prophet succinctly intertwines the two in verse 14, stating, 'And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast which had the wound by a sword, and did live.' The deception, expertly orchestrated through the execution of miracles, sets the stage for the willing acquiescence to the demand for the formation of an image dedicated to the beast.
To fully comprehend what an image of the papal beast would entail, we must first elucidate our understanding of the papacy itself. The complete manifestation of the beast, or the instatement of papal supremacy, was initiated with the eminent letter of Justinian, enacted in AD 538, which positioned the pope as the pinnacle of the church and the arbitrator of heretics. The papacy, an ecclesiastical entity vested with civil authority, wielded its power to suppress dissenters through the confiscation of property, incarceration, torture, and even death. So, what would constitute an image of the papacy? Essentially, it would be another ecclesiastical institution vested with civil authority - a church-state amalgamation. How could such an image manifest in the United States? Should the Protestant churches be endowed with the power to define and penalize heresy, to enforce their doctrines through civil laws and penalties, would that not be a precise echo of the papacy during its zenith?
Indeed, it would be. Yet, could such a scenario transpire in a nation whose bedrock principles are civil and religious liberty, where each individual's inalienable rights to 'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness' have been respected throughout the ages? Let us scrutinize the evidence.
A Nation Established on Liberty. The divine intervention was evident in the noble and God-fearing men who laid the foundations of this new nation. The Hon. Henry D. Estabrook, addressing the Connecticut Bar Association, eloquently stated, 'On this great continent, which God had kept hidden in a little world here, with a new heaven and a new earth, where former things had passed away, the people of many nations, of various needs and creeds, but united in heart and soul and mind for the single purpose, builded an altar to Liberty, the first ever built or that ever could be built, and called it The Constitution of the United States.' 
This was in 1787. The prophet envisioned the lamblike beast emerging from the earth around 1798 – surely, this is more than mere coincidence. George Washington, the inaugural President of the United States, in his first address, proclaimed, 'No people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the Invisible Hand which conducts the affairs of men more than the people of the United States. Every step by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation, seems to have been distinguished by some token of providential agency.' 
In response to this notable address, the Senate acknowledged, 'When we contemplate the coincidence of circumstances, and wonderful combination of causes, which gradually prepared the people of this country for independence; when we contemplate the rise, progress, and termination of the late war, which gave them a name among the nations of the earth; we are, with you, unavoidably led to acknowledge and adore the great Arbiter of the universe, by whom empires rise and fall.' 
Resistance Against Religious Despotism. These men were not only godly, but they were also imbued with wisdom and foresight.
When certain religious factions sought an 'explicit acknowledgment of the true God and Jesus Christ' within the Constitution, their appeal was dismissed. Reflecting on this event, Thomas Jefferson commented: 'The insertion was rejected by a great majority, in proof that they meant to comprehend within the mantle of its protection the Jew and the Gentile, the Christian and Mahometan, the Hindoo, and Infidel of every denomination.' 
Responding to a similar appeal, the House Judiciary Committee, on February 18, 1874, declared: 'As this country, the foundation of whose government they were then laying, was to be the home of the oppressed of all nations of the earth, whether Christian or pagan, and in full realization of the dangers which the union between church and state had imposed upon so many nations of the Old World, with great unanimity [they agreed] that it was inexpedient to put anything into the Constitution or frame of government which might be construed to be a reference to any religious creed or doctrine.' 
Such prudence demonstrated by the founding fathers underlines the steadfast commitment to liberty that underpins the birth of the nation. It is these principles of freedom and respect for all faiths that have been the bulwark against religious tyranny, safeguarding the diversity and unity of the United States. Yet, the question remains - could this sanctuary of liberty and diversity yield to a resurgence of the papal beast, an ecclesiastical institution vested with civil authority? Only a vigilant exploration of unfolding events and a deep understanding of the past can guide us toward an answer.

The annals of history bear witness to the prescient foresight of those noble men who laid the foundation stones for the United States. They perceived, almost prophetically, the looming threats to personal liberty that would one day confront the nation. Their apprehensions were eloquently articulated by Thomas Jefferson, who warned, 'The spirit of the times may alter, will alter. Our rulers will become corrupt, our people careless. A single zealot may commence persecution, and better men be his victims... The shackles, therefore, which shall not be knocked off at the conclusion of this war, will remain on us long, will be made heavier and heavier, till our rights shall revive or expire in a convulsion.' 
On the Fourth of July, 1788, Justice James Wilson delivered a penetrating discourse, highlighting the insidious machinations of liberty's adversaries. He elucidated, 'The enemies of liberty are artful and insidious. A counterfeit steals her dress, imitates her manner, forges her signature, assumes her name... Generally, however, this bold impostor acts only a secondary part. Though she alone appear upon the stage, her motions are regulated by dark ambition, who sits concealed behind the curtain, and who knows that despotism, his other favorite, can always follow the success of licentiousness. Against these enemies of liberty, who act in concert, though they appear on opposite side, the patriot citizen will keep a watchful guard.' 
In the prophetic vista that unfolded before John, he observed a startling transformation in the nature of the two-horned beast. It began to speak 'as a dragon,' exerting control over the worship of its people, instructing them to create an 'image to the beast.'
This beast, 'which had the wound by a sword, and did live,' represents the papacy, a church wielding control over the civil power, embodying a union of church and state. An image to this beast would symbolize another ecclesiastical establishment vested with civil power, another church-state union enforcing religious doctrines by law.
Signs that such an image is in the process of formation are apparent. Influential organizations, such as the National Reform Association, the International Reform Bureau, and the Lord's Day Alliance of Christ in America, have been established by professed Protestants. These organizations have worked relentlessly towards the establishment and enforcement of religious standards by law. Simultaneously, Roman Catholic societies in the United States, in accordance with their centuries-old tradition, aspire towards a similar goal. These two forces are destined to converge in a common endeavor.
The declared aim of the National Reform Association is 'to secure such an amendment to the Constitution of the United States as will . . . indicate that this is a Christian nation, and place all the Christian laws, institutions, and usages of our government on an undeniably legal basis in the fundamental law of the land.' 
Commenting on the proposition of declaring the United States a 'Christian nation,' Bishop Earl Cranston, D. D., of the Methodist Episcopal Church, delivered the following observation in an address at the Foundry Methodist Church, Washington, D.C., on March 13, 1910:
'Imagine if we were to interpret the Constitution in such a way that this nation is declared Christian. What would this imply? Which of the conflicting interpretations of Christianity would 'Christian' denote? Naturally, the Protestant notion, for the majority governs in our system, and most Americans are Protestants. However, suppose, through the acquisition of adjoining territories with an influx of twelve or more million Roman Catholics, the annexation of a few more islands adding half as many again, and the continuation of the current rate of immigration, the majority in the future becomes Roman Catholics. Who can doubt that the incumbent Pope would claim control over legislation and governance? He would assert confidently and consistently, 'This is a Christian nation. It was proclaimed so from its inception and declared such many years ago. The majority then defined what Christianity was, and the majority now will define what Christianity is and will be.' That 'majority' would be the Pope.' 
The association formed for the so-called 'National Reform' harbors no qualms about aligning with the papacy to realize its ambition of establishing a national religion. It proclaims, 'We cordially, gladly, recognize the fact that in the South American Republics, and in France and other European countries, the Roman Catholics are the recognized advocates of national Christianity... Whenever they are willing to co-operate in resisting the progress of political atheism, will gladly join hands with them.' 
Let us consider the stated goals of other organizations.
In a self-assessment within a History of the International Reform Bureau, the society asserts, 'The Reform Bureau is the first 'Christian lobby' established at our National Capital to speak to government in behalf of all denominations.'
It is articulated within the aforementioned document that one of the primary aims of this and similar organizations is the enforcement of compulsory Sunday legislation.
While testifying before the United States Senate Judiciary Committee against the Supreme Court bill, Professor Theodore Graebner of Concordia College, St. Louis, made an intriguing remark: 'Some 50 years ago the national Reform Association sought... to make all public education Christian and thereby make Jesus Christ the King of the nation... The movement persists to the present day, and is issuing an enormous amount of literature all directed to the end of adopting a Christian amendment.' 
The organization's actual aim is to impose religion on the populace through legal means, to enact a Sunday blue law, and to standardize the nation's Christianity. A pamphlet by the Lord's Day Alliance of the United States reveals their objectives as: '(1) To preserve the Lord's day [Sunday] for America; (2) to secure an active Alliance in every State not yet organized; (3) to induce the general government as far as possible to set the example of Sabbath observance.'
All of this signifies the pursuit of compulsory state and national Sunday legislation—the very mechanism through which the church gained control of the state and united church and state in the fourth and fifth centuries of the Christian era.
The Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America, representing the most influential and representative amalgamation of Protestant churches in the country, and claiming to represent eighteen organizations and 50,000,000 communicants at its inception, stated its raison d'etre as: 'That the great Christian bodies of our country should stand together... [in dealing with] questions like those of marriage and divorce, Sabbath desecration, social evils,' etc. 
In outlining their approach to combating Sabbath desecration, the Federal Council proclaimed: 'That all encroachments upon the claims and the sanctities of the Lord's day should be stoutly resisted through the press, the Lord's day associations and alliances, and by such legislation as may be secured to protect and preserve this
bulwark of our American Christianity.' 

In our examination of these organizations, we note a common objective: the legislative enforcement of Sunday observance, ostensibly as part of a wider strategy to 'Christianize' the nation. However, in pursuing this course, many risk undermining the very principles of Christianity and Protestantism, as well as the bedrock principles of the United States government. They may, unwittingly, play into the hands of the very power that first instituted the Sunday Sabbath and subsequently seized control of the state through Sunday legislation: the papacy.
This potential hazard was anticipated by the architects of our nation more than a hundred years ago. In 1830, a proposal for prohibiting mail transportation and the opening of post offices on Sunday was brought before the Senate of the United States. The Senate, however, rejected the proposal, noting that such legislation would infringe upon the constitutionally protected rights of individual conscience. The Senate declared, in no uncertain terms, that the United States Constitution acknowledges no authority to legislate on matters of divine revelation or religious duty. The framers of the Constitution, they noted, acknowledged the eternal principle that man's relationship with his God is beyond the jurisdiction of human legislation, and his rights of conscience are inviolable. 
The desire to legislate morality, to establish righteousness by law, is a misguided endeavour fraught with danger. This is not to denigrate the noble service that Protestant churches have rendered to humanity and to the world. Indeed, the propagation of the gospel, the championing of freedom, and the defence of the principles of Protestantism are worthy of the highest praise.
We bear no animosity towards those involved in these efforts. They are men of high moral standing, genuinely concerned for the welfare of the nation, and sincerely attempting to address the rampant social ills of our time. Their endeavours will undoubtedly yield much good, and we wish them all possible success in their efforts to promote temperance, eliminate war, safeguard youth, and pursue other noble causes. For these causes, all Christians are bound to work and pray.
However, why then do these good men risk contravening the solemn warnings of the Bible? The answer, perhaps, is that they have deviated from the divine guidance offered in the Scriptures, attempting to establish righteousness and the kingdom of God on earth through their own means. They have overlooked the prophetic elements of the Bible, which provide insight into the ongoing conflict between the kingdom of Christ and that of Satan, and how one can co-operate with God's providence in the current times. They have lost touch with the divine Leader and the tools He employs to advance His kingdom on earth. They have misunderstood the nature of the coming kingdom, anticipating a kingdom intertwined with earthly elements, to be established through worldly means such as the ballot, legislation, and education.
Given these circumstances, it is not surprising that their efforts may run counter to the providence of God. The failure to heed and be guided by God's word is a grave mistake. Indeed, the more zeal a church exhibits in pursuing a misguided course, the greater the potential damage it may inflict.

The Apostle Paul speaks of a time when men would exhibit 'a form of godliness,' yet renounce 'the power thereof.' It is with profound regret that we observe the Protestant church mirroring this prophetic depiction. While there is an absence of divine power, the external rituals of true Christian worship persist. As the spirit and power of God fade, the churches increasingly lean on the state to compensate for their deficiencies. History bears witness to the fact that as a popular and extensive ecclesiastical body loses the essence and power of God, it appeals to the support of civil authority, leading to the eventual incorporation of religion within the state. This evolution is eerily reminiscent of the prophecy: 'He had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.' (Revelation 13: 15)
Imagine an ecclesiastical organization being formed and legalized by the government, granting it the power to enforce religious doctrines that various denominations agree on as a unifying principle. This precisely mirrors the prophecy of an image of the papal beast being endowed with life by the two-horned beast, capable of speaking and wielding power.
Moving onto the 'Mark of the Beast,' this prophecy introduces three entities that must be carefully differentiated to avoid confusion.
The papal beast, otherwise referred to as 'the beast,' 'the first beast,' 'the beast which had the wound by a sword, and did live,' and 'the beast whose deadly wound was healed,' these phrases all denote the same power, the papacy, within the context of this prophecy.
The two-horned beast, introduced in Revelation 13: 11, and referenced throughout the prophecy by the pronoun 'he,' consistently represents this two-horned beast (with a possible exception in verse 16, which might refer to the image).
The image of the beast is typically referred to as 'the image' in subsequent chapters of Revelation, thus there's little risk of misidentification. The image's actions are symbolized by speaking like a dragon and compelling worship of itself under the threat of death. This is the sole act enforced by death penalty in this prophecy.
The mark of the beast is imposed by the two-horned beast, either directly or via the image. Refusing to accept this mark entails a loss of social privileges, including the right to buy and sell. This mark is that of the papal beast. A grave and compelling warning against the worship of the beast, his image, and the acceptance of his mark is issued in the third angel's message of Revelation 14: 9-12.
According to this prophecy, we are on the cusp of facing this critical juncture. Human organizations, guided and motivated by the dragon's spirit, will command men to perform acts tantamount to worshipping an apostate religious power and accepting its mark. Those who refuse will be stripped of their citizenship rights and rendered outlaws. They will either conform, thereby worshipping the image of the beast, or risk their lives. Conversely, God issues a message just before this perilous crisis befalls the people, as we will explore in Revelation 14: 9-12, declaring that anyone who complies 'shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of His indignation.' The choice between obeying God or man will be made under the most severe pressure from both sides ever faced by any generation.


To warrant the invocation of such a vehement wrath, the worship of the beast, his image, and the acceptance of his mark must indeed represent the gravest transgression against the Divine. This transgression, as has been previously noted, is an event destined for the end times. God, in His boundless wisdom, has provided ample evidence within His sacred text to discern when these last days are upon us. Thus, none need be blindsided by the arrival of the Day of the Lord. Similarly, He has bestowed upon us the means to interpret the reception of the beast's mark, empowering us to circumvent the catastrophic penalty inevitably accompanying its acceptance. Surely, God does not play capricious games with human hopes and destinies; He would not declare such a dreadful fate for a specific sin, only to render it impossible for us to comprehend what that sin might be, leaving us defenseless against it.
We thus turn our gaze to the crucial question: What constitutes the mark of the beast?
The metaphor of a mark is derived from an age-old custom. Thomas Newton elucidates: 'It was customary among the ancients for servants to receive the mark of their master, and soldiers of their general, and those who were devoted to any particular deity, of the particular deity to whom they were devoted. These marks were usually impressed on their right hand or on their forehead, and consisted of some hieroglyphic characters, or of the name expressed in vulgar letters, or of the name disguised in numerical letters, according to the fancy of the imposer.' 
Prideaux narrates that Ptolemy Philopater mandated all Jews seeking citizenship in Alexandria to be branded with the form of an ivy leaf, the emblem of his god, Bacchus, with a hot iron, under threat of death.
The Greek term employed for mark in this prophecy is charagma, implying 'a graving, sculpture; a mark cut in or stamped.' It appears nine times in the New Testament and, except for Acts 17: 29, refers exclusively to the mark of the beast. As we interpret this symbolic prophecy, we must remember that we are not dealing with a literal mark but rather with an allegorical representation of certain acts signified by the mark in the past. The ancient, literal mark denoted servitude and allegiance to the bearer of the mark; therefore, the mark of the beast, or the papacy, must represent an act or profession acknowledging its authority. What might this be?
The papal power, naturally, would be the source of such a mark. Daniel depicts this power as a small horn waging a unique war against God, oppressing His saints, and presuming to alter times and laws. The prophet specifically states: 'He shall ... think to change times and laws.' (Daniel 7: 25). These laws must surely be God's laws. To interpret them as human laws would grossly violate the prophetic language. When applied to God's laws, the prophecy reads coherently and powerfully: 'He shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and shall think to change the times and laws of the Most High.'
The Hebrew word for 'law' is dath, and the Septuagint reads, nomos, in the singular, suggesting the law of God. The papacy has demonstrated its ability to manipulate human laws at will, nullifying royal decrees, absolving subjects from their sovereigns, and bringing rulers to their knees. However, the prophet perceives a greater act of presumption. He sees the papacy attempting, albeit failing, to do what is beyond the capability of any man or group of men: changing the law of 
the Most High. It is essential to keep this prophetic vision in mind as we examine another sacred writer's testimony on this very point.
The papacy's audacity extended beyond the mere alteration of human laws; it contemplated an unthinkable challenge to the divine. It attempted to alter the immutable laws of the Most High. This audacious endeavor, however, was destined to remain but an aspiration, for no earthly power can truly alter the divine precepts. The prophecy reveals a portrayal of this power endeavoring to accomplish the unachievable, daring to challenge the absolute and eternal laws of the Most High.
As we move forward in our examination of the evidence, it is crucial to remember that the mark of the beast must be an acknowledgment, however subtle or implicit, of the authority of the papacy. It stands as a symbol not of outward branding, but of inward submission—a willingness to uphold the principles of an earthly power over the divine edicts of the Most High. In the solemn dance between prophecy and its fulfillment, we must seek not the literal imprint of an ancient mark, but the spiritual sign of allegiance to a power that dares to challenge the divine.
Understanding this, the mark of the beast becomes not an arcane symbol, but a profound warning against surrendering our allegiance to earthly powers. It stands as a caution against the subtle allure of idolatry and the danger of compromising divine principles for earthly gains.

The Apostle Paul, in his epistle to the Thessalonians, paints a striking portrait of this power in the guise of the Pope, branding him as 'that man of sin,' who audaciously positions himself 'as God in the temple of God,' otherwise known as the Church. He portrays the Pope as exalting himself 'above all that is called God, or that is worshiped.' This powerful imagery serves to illustrate how the Pope assumes the mantle of divine authority within the Church, supplanting the rightful place of God Himself.
Consider the gravity of this assertion. How might a mortal being dare to elevate himself above the divine? What stratagem, power, or claim could propel this audacious usurper to a pedestal higher than God's? One might conceive a litany of ceremonies, prescribe myriad forms of worship, or display an impressive show of power. Yet, as long as God's ordinances hold sway over the faithful, the Pope's influence remains subordinate. Suppose he legislates a law, coercing the faithful into believing that they are as obliged to obey his edict as God's commandment. In such a case, he merely positions himself as God's equal.
However, the prophecy foretells of an even more audacious feat: the Pope, it is said, will strive to elevate himself beyond God's stature. To achieve this, he must enact a law that directly contravenes God's law, demanding that his own law supersede God's. The most effective strategy to fulfill this prophetic role would be to modify God's law. If he can convince the faithful to adhere to his revised law in place of God's original commandments, he effectively crowns himself as superior to God, the ultimate Lawgiver. This is precisely the act that the prophet Daniel predicted would be the ambition of the power symbolized by the 'little horn.'
According to the prophecy, the papacy is destined to accomplish this audacious act, and prophecy is infallible. When this occurs, humanity is confronted with a choice between two laws: the original divine law, embodying God's will and His claim upon His creations, and the altered version promulgated by the Pope, reflecting his will. The law they choose to follow determines their allegiance. If they adhere to God's original law, they honor and obey God. Conversely, if they abide by the revised law, they pay homage to the papacy.
However, the prophecy does not suggest that the papacy will completely replace God's law with a new one, which would be tantamount to proposing a new law rather than modifying the existing one. The papacy merely endeavors to alter the law, resulting in a remarkable similarity between the divine law and the papal law, save for the changes made by the papacy. Both laws share several commonalities, yet no shared commandment can distinguish a follower of God from a follower of the papacy. Only when a modified commandment is put into practice, the distinction becomes apparent: those who follow the commandment as originally bestowed by God are marked as God's worshippers, while those adhering to the altered commandment bear the mark of the power that initiated the change.
From this analysis, an unambiguous response emerges to the question, 'What constitutes the mark of the beast?' Simply put, the mark of the beast is the modification the beast endeavored to make in God's law.
We now seek to identify this alteration. By God's law, we refer to the moral law, the only immutable and eternally obligatory law in existence. As defined by Noah Webster, a respected lexicographer, the moral law is primarily encapsulated in the Decalogue, God's commandments written on two stone tablets and handed to Moses atop Mount Sinai, an event forever etched in the annals of human history and religious tradition.
One might inquire: what is this alteration that the papacy has dared to introduce into God's immutable moral law? The audacity to alter the commandments written by the divine finger of God Himself, upon two stone tablets, is an act of unparalleled presumption. This audacious act serves as a symbol, a mark, signifying the usurper's attempts to impose his will upon the very moral fabric established by God, thus superseding the divine.
It is essential to recognize that the change in question is not a wholesale replacement of God's laws but an alteration, a subtle yet significant modification. Such a modification must be designed so cleverly that the revised law closely mirrors the original, save for the alterations instigated by the papacy. The laws, in essence, are identical, barring the changes, and thus, superficially, they seem to convey the same moral obligations.
But a discerning eye will notice that while both laws may command, 'Thou shalt not kill,' and a person may abide by this decree, it remains impossible to ascertain by the adherence to this particular commandment alone whether the individual intends to honor God or the Pope. However, when a commandment that has been altered comes into play, the distinction becomes evident. Those who observe the commandment as originally decreed by God signal their allegiance to the divine, while those who follow the altered commandment reveal their deference to the papacy, the power that instigated the change.
This distinction, subtle yet profound, constitutes the essence of the 'mark of the beast.' The beast, or the papacy, has dared to alter God's law, and those who adhere to this altered law bear the mark of the beast. They have chosen to follow the papacy's will over God's divine commandments. Thus, the mark is not a physical symbol but a spiritual and moral choice, reflecting one's ultimate loyalty and allegiance.

The profound prophecy found in Daniel 7:25 foretells of the Papacy's audacious intent to 'think to change times and laws.' We previously furnished evidence from the esteemed Roman Catechism, a text steeped in the unassailable authority of the Council of Trent and published under the auspices of Pope Pius V. This text acknowledges the church's initiative to transpose the Sabbath day from the seventh to the first day of the week.
While the Catechism dutifully records the fourth commandment in its entirety, as it appears in the Scripture, and the Latin Vulgate—the official Catholic Bible—preserves it in full, along with its official English counterpart, the Douay Bible, the contemporary pedagogical catechisms provided for Roman Catholic priests and teachers significantly truncate this commandment. They maintain only the initial directive: 'Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day,' appending an extensive testimony affirming the Sabbath day's transposition from Saturday to Sunday, a change enacted under the authority of the Catholic Church and its venerable apostolic tradition.
Regardless of the faithful rendition of the entire commandment in both the Catechism of the Council of Trent and the Roman Catholic Bible, the church's prelates and priests predominantly advocate for the observance of a Sabbath institution relocated to the first day of the week, underscoring the church's authority in this matter.
One must remember that the prophecy stipulates an intent or design to change times and laws. This wording implies a premeditated act, an intentional alteration. Concerning the second commandment's omission, Catholics maintain that it is encapsulated within the first and should not be counted separately. They further argue that the tenth commandment does not require bifurcation as the ideas therein are not distinct enough. Consequently, they label coveting a neighbor's wife as the ninth commandment and desiring his possessions as the tenth.
In these interpretations, they assert their fidelity to God's original intent, presenting the commandments as they believe God desired them to be understood. Although we might perceive these as misinterpretations, they cannot be classified as intentional changes. A different situation, however, arises with the fourth commandment. The Church does not assert that their rendition aligns with God's original dictate. Instead, they openly declare a change, attributing this transformation to the Church's authority. The subsequent catechisms, bearing their ecclesiastical seal of approval, exemplify this alteration.
Even the simpler catechisms, which do not discuss the shift in religious days, categorically state that the Sabbath commandment advocates Sunday observance:

'Q. Say the Third Commandment.
'A. Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day. 'Q. What is commanded by the Third Commandment? 'A. To sanctify the Sunday.' 
Others say that the Catholic Church changed the day of worship. In A New Catechism of Christian Doctrine and Practice, we find the following under the subject of the third commandment:
'What day was the Sabbath? 'The seventh day, our Saturday. 'Do you keep the Sabbath? 'No: we keep the Lord's Day. 'Which is that?
'The first day: Sunday. 'Who changed it?
'The Catholic Church.'
In the well-known Baltimore catechism, we find this explanation:
'Q. What is the third Commandment?
'A. The third Commandment is: Remember thou keep holy the Sabbath day. 'Q. What are we commanded by the third Commandment?
'A. By the third Commandment we are commanded to keep holy the Lord's day. . . . '
Q. Are the Sabbath day and the Sunday the same?
'A. The Sabbath day and the Sunday are not the same. The Sabbath day is the seventh day of the week, and is the day which was kept holy in the old law; the Sunday is the first day of the week, and is the day which is kept holy in the new law.
'Q. Why does the Church command us to keep the Sunday holy instead of the Sabbath?
'A. The Church commands us to keep the Sunday holy instead of the Sabbath because on Sunday Christ rose from the dead, and on Sunday He sent the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles.' 
In The Catholic Christian Instructed we read:
'Q. What warrant have you for keeping the Sunday preferably to the ancient Sabbath, which was the Saturday?
'A. We have for it the authority of the Catholic Church, and apostolic tradition. '
Q. Does the Scripture anywhere command the Sunday to be kept for the Sabbath?
'A. The Scripture commands us to hear the church (Matt. 18: 17; Luke 10: 16), and to hold fast the traditions of the apostles (2 Thess. 2: 15), but the Scriptures do not in particular mention this change of the Sabbath.' 
In A Doctrinal Catechism we find further testimony to the same point:
'Ques. Have you any other way of proving that the church has power to institute festivals of precept? 'Ans. Had she not such power, she could not have done that in which all modern religionists agree with her she could not have substituted the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, for the observance of Saturday, the seventh day, a change for which there is no Scriptural authority.' 
In An Abridgment of the Christian Doctrine we find this testimony:
'Q. How prove you that the church hath power to command feast and holy days?
'A. By the very act of changing the Sabbath into Sunday, which Protestants allow of; and therefore they fondly contradict themselves by keeping Sunday strictly, and breaking most other feasts commanded by the same church.
'Q. How prove you that?
'A. Because by keeping Sunday they acknowledge the church's power to ordain feasts, and to command them under sin.'
In The Catechism Simply Explained, are these questions and answers:
'What is the third commandment?
'The third commandment is, 'Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day.' 'What are we commanded by the third commandment?
'By the third commandment we are commanded to keep the Sunday holy.
'The Jew's Sabbath Day was the Saturday; we Christians keep the Sunday holy. The Church, by the power our Lord gave her, changed the observance of the Saturday to the Sunday.'

The Papal authority lays claim to the audacious act of transmuting the fourth commandment. They candidly acknowledge that their shift lacks Scriptural endorsement, asserting that it is grounded solely on the Church's authority. They champion the act of metamorphosing the Sabbath into Sunday as a symbol, or mark, of the Church's authority, brandishing it as evidence of its potent influence.
Yet, some might protest, 'I presumed that Christ initiated the Sabbath's change.' Many harbor this notion, having been so instructed. To those individuals, we offer a gentle reminder that, according to prophecy, the sole modification ever to be made to God's law was to be undertaken by the little horn of Daniel 7, the man of sin referenced in 2 Thessalonians 2. The singular alteration that has occurred is the transformation of the Sabbath. If we attribute this shift to Christ, we inadvertently designate Him as the blasphemous power described by both Daniel and Paul—an inference undoubtedly repugnant to any Christian.
Why should anyone strive to demonstrate that Christ altered the Sabbath? Those who undertake this task will find it thankless. The Pope will offer no gratitude; if one proves that Christ enacted the change, the Pope is divested of his emblem of authority and power. No truly enlightened Protestant will express thanks; if the attempt is successful, it merely illustrates that the Papacy has not performed the prophesied work, suggesting a failure of prophecy and casting doubt on the Scriptures' reliability. The situation is best left as the prophecy delineates, and the claim which the Pope unwittingly asserts should be conceded.
When an individual is accused of a deed, and that individual steps forward admitting to the act, such an admission is generally deemed sufficient to resolve the matter. Similarly, when prophecy declares that a certain power shall alter God's law, and in due course that very power emerges, accomplishes the foretold deed, and then openly professes its culpability, what need have we for further evidence?
The world should remember that the significant apostasy forecasted by Paul has transpired; the man of sin held near-exclusive sway over Christian teachings for many centuries. The mystery of iniquity has cast its shadow of darkness and erroneous doctrines over almost all of Christendom, and from this epoch of misconception and corruption, contemporary theology has emerged. Should we then find it surprising if there remain remnants of papacy to be discarded before the Reformation reaches completion?
Alexander Campbell, the founder of the Disciples of Christ Church, commenting on various Protestant sects, observed that all retain fragments of papacy in their ecclesiastical structures, rituals, doctrines, and observances. He postulates that they are, at best, partial reformations of papacy, with human doctrines and traditions still impeding the gospel's power and progress.
The nature of the change attempted by the little horn in God's law is worth noting. Committed to his objective of self-exaltation above God, he endeavored to alter the commandment that serves as the bedrock of the law, the one that identifies the lawgiver and bears his royal signature—the fourth commandment. No other commandment serves this function. While four others mention God and three cite the Lord, the question remains: who is this Lord God to whom they refer? Without the fourth commandment, this question remains unanswered, as idolaters apply these terms to the countless objects of their devotion. The fourth commandment unequivocally identifies the Author of the Decalogue, instantly nullifying the claims of all false deities. It calls for our worship, not of any created being, but of the One who created all things—the Architect of the earth, the sea, the sun, the moon, and the celestial bodies—the Sovereign of the universe, the One who asserts, and by His standing has the right to assert, our highest reverence over every other entity. The commandment that imparts these truths is the very one we might anticipate a power, intending to elevate itself above God, would endeavor to change. God established the Sabbath as a weekly reminder of Himself and as a memorial of His creation of the heavens and the earth—an imposing bulwark against paganism and idolatry. It is the signature and seal of the law. Yet, the Papacy, in its teachings and practices, has displaced it from its position and supplanted it with another institution, one that the Church proclaims as the symbol of its authority.
The Papacy, true to its purpose to rise above God, has attempted to alter the foundational commandment of the law, the one that reveals the identity of the lawgiver and carries His royal signature. This is achieved by the fourth commandment; no other commandment carries this distinction. While four others contain the term 'God' and three mention 'Lord,' the question remains: who is this Lord God they refer to? Without the fourth commandment, this question remains unanswered, as idolaters of all grades use these terms to denote the numerous objects of their worship.
With the fourth commandment to point out the author of the Decalogue, the claims of every false deity are nullified in one swift motion. The God who calls for our worship is not any created being, but the one who created all things. The Creator of the earth and the sea, the sun, the moon, and all the celestial hosts, the Sustainer and Ruler of the universe, is the One who demands—and rightfully so—our supreme reverence in comparison to all other entities.
The commandment that makes these facts known is therefore the very one we might anticipate a power, seeking to elevate itself above God, would attempt to alter. God gifted us the Sabbath as a weekly reminder of His presence, a memorial of His work in creating the heavens and the earth, a significant barrier against paganism and idolatry. It is the signature and seal of the law. Yet, this is the very commandment that the Papacy, through its teachings and practices, has displaced, substituting it with another institution, one which the Church itself declares as the sign of its authority.

The modification of the fourth commandment must surely be the change indicated by prophecy, and thus, the Sunday Sabbath could be construed as the mark of the beast. Such a conclusion may evoke sentiments of shock, even horror, from those who have long been taught to revere this institution. Alas, within the confines of this discourse, there is insufficient space, and perhaps it is not even the appropriate platform, to embark on an elaborate debate on the Sabbath question, or to expound on the origin and nature of the observance of the first day of the week. Nevertheless, let us propose a single premise: if the seventh day remains the Sabbath as mandated in the fourth commandment; if the observance of the first day of the week is entirely devoid of Scriptural foundation; if this observance has been introduced as a Christian institution and deliberately put in the place of the decalogue's Sabbath by the power symbolized by the beast, and set there as an emblem and token of its authority to legislate for the Church—isn't the shift from Sabbath to Sunday incontrovertibly the mark of the beast? The response must, inevitably, be affirmative. The hypotheses put forth are, indeed, certainties.
The question will undoubtedly arise: Who then carries the mark of the beast? It may be stated, 'Therefore, all Sunday observers bear the mark of the beast; thus, all the virtuous individuals of past epochs who observed this day carried the mark of the beast; hence, Luther, Whitefield, the Wesleys, and all those who have undertaken significant and noble reformation work, bore the mark of the beast; thus, all the blessings that have been bestowed upon the reformed churches have been bestowed upon those bearing the mark of the beast; and all contemporary Christians observing Sunday as the Sabbath, carry the mark of the beast.' To this, we respond, 'Not so!' It is regrettable that some purportedly religious teachers, despite numerous corrections, persist in misrepresenting our standpoint. We have never endorsed such a view; we have never propagated such teachings. Our premises do not lead to such conclusions.
Your close attention is requested here. The mark and the worship of the beast are enforced by the two-horned beast. The reception of the mark of the beast is a distinct act which the two-horned beast is to instigate. The third angel's message of Revelation 14 serves as a merciful warning dispatched ahead of time to prepare the people for the looming peril. Hence, there can be no worship of the beast, nor reception of his mark in the manner contemplated by prophecy, until it is imposed by the two-horned beast, and knowingly accepted by the individual. We have established that intention was vital to the change which the papacy has implemented in the law of God, to designate it as the mark of that power; thus, intention is requisite in the individual's acceptance of that change, to constitute it as the receipt of that mark. In other words, an individual must adopt the change, acknowledging it as the work of the beast, and receive it on the authority of that power in defiance of the command of God, before it can be declared that he has received the mark of the beast.
But what of those aforementioned individuals who have observed Sunday in the past, and the majority of those who continue to do so today? Do they observe it as an institution of the papacy? Certainly not. Have they made a conscious choice between this and the Lord's Sabbath, understanding the claims of each? Absolutely not. On what grounds have they observed it, and why do they continue to do so? They believe they are obeying a commandment of God. Do such individuals carry the mark of the beast?
Undeniably not. Their course can be attributed to an error inadvertently received from the Church of Rome, rather than an act of worship consciously rendered to it.
This distinction, while subtle, is vital. Their adherence to the practice of Sunday observance is not an act of fealty to the papal authority but rather a consequence of a historical misstep, a misinterpretation passed down through generations. They stand in the belief that they are honoring a divine mandate, not fulfilling the whims of a mortal institution. Hence, they remain free of the mark of the beast in their observance, for they lack the essential element of intent, the conscious acceptance of the beast's authority over God's command.
With the advent of the third angel's message of Revelation 14, a clarion call is sent forth, a divine warning against the conscious acceptance of the beast's mark. Until this message resonates across the world, and the two-horned beast exerts its influence, there can be no reception of the beast's mark in the prophetic sense. The mark of the beast, as foretold, is not a mark received unknowingly, but one accepted with full knowledge of its origin and implications.
To apply the mark of the beast to those who, in their hearts, are genuinely seeking to serve God according to the best of their understanding, would be an injustice. For the mark is not a sign of mistaken worship; it is a symbol of intentional rebellion. It is given not to those who are unwitting in their error but to those who willingly and knowingly choose the authority of the beast over the commandment of God.
We stand at a moment in time where many are yet unaware of the conflict at hand. The majority of Sunday observers are not acting out of rebellious defiance but are instead victims of inherited misconception. Yet, the time will come when the truth of the Sabbath will be made clear, and all will be called upon to make a choice. It is then, and only then, that the mark will be given—to those who choose the authority of the beast, knowing it contradicts the word of God.
Until such time, we must remember that the mark of the beast is more than mere observance—it requires an understanding and a choice. It is not enough to follow tradition or to trust in the teachings of the past. Each individual must seek the truth for themselves, through prayer and study, and choose to follow God's commandments rather than the traditions of men. It is in this understanding and in this choice, that the mark of the beast truly lies.

In the annals of our nation, we can affirm with a measure of pride that esteemed statesmen have diligently curtailed the dangers foreseen by our founding fathers. Yet, we cannot turn a blind eye to the reality that alongside these honourable efforts, fervent yet misguided religious figures have endeavoured to impose religious customs through civic channels.
The prophecy foretells a period of tribulation, wherein the two-horned beast compels all to accept a mark, decreeing death to those who reject the worship of its image. It does not, however, necessitate that all, or even many, will succumb to such a fate. Divine intervention will shield His faithful followers. Those who have clung to the word of Christ's patience will be safeguarded amidst this testing time (Revelation 3: 10). Those who have sought refuge in God will be shielded from all harm (Psalm 91: 9, 10). All inscribed in the divine ledger will find salvation (Daniel 12: 1). Emerging victorious over the beast and its image, they will be redeemed, lifting a triumphant anthem before God's throne (Revelation 14: 2-4).

The prophecy proclaims that the number of the beast 'is the number of a man.' Naturally, if this number is to be derived from a name or title, it logically follows that it should be the name or title of a specific or representative individual. Among various conjectures, the most convincing proposition is that the number arises from a title bestowed upon the Pope of Rome: Vicarius Filii Dei, meaning 'Vicar of the Son of God.' It is intriguing to observe that the Douay Bible, a version favoured by the Roman Catholic Church, comments on Revelation 13:18, stating that 'The numeral letters of his name shall make up this number.' Extracting the letters in the title that also serve as Roman numerals—V, 5; I, 1; C, 100; I, 1; U (anciently equivalent to V), 5; I, 1; L, 50; I, 1; I, 1; D, 500; I, 1—and aggregating them, we arrive precisely at the number 666.
Some argue that the number should be calculated using Greek gematria, as the Book of Revelation was penned in Greek. However, given that the title is rendered in Latin and Latin is the official language of the Roman Church and its chosen Bible, the Vulgate, this argument loses its validity. It is more reasonable to apply Latin numerical values to a Latin title.
The ancient custom of symbolising names by numbers is well-documented. 'It was a method practiced among the ancients, to denote names by numbers,' we are informed. This practice of numerical representation of names was prevalent among pagans, Jews, and Christians alike. Thus, the beast too, in this tradition of ancient number symbolism, possesses a number, 666.
The title Vicarius Filii Dei, or its similar variants, has been so frequently used in Roman Catholic literature and rituals across the centuries, that it seems almost unnecessary to further validate its significance. Some of these variations include: Vicar of Christ, Vicar of Jesus Christ, Vicar of God. Cardinal Manning, a noted Catholic authority, has employed these various forms in his discourses.
The significance of the Pope's role, as indicated by the title or its equivalents, is underscored in J. A. Wylie's commentary on the Apology of Ennodius, written in defence of Pope Symmachus. He cites the council of Rome (AD 502 or 503) refusing to investigate charges against Pope Symmachus, based on Ennodius's assertion that the Pope, being God's Vicar, was the judge of all and could be judged by none. This claim laid the foundation for the massive power the popes of Rome would later amass.
Although recent years have seen the validity of this title questioned, historical evidence persists that this self-assumed title has played a crucial role in bolstering the Pope's authority. It has underpinned the establishment of their substantial temporal supremacy during the height of Romanism in the Middle Ages and continues to uphold their spiritual authority today.
The specific title Vicarius Filii Dei appears as early as 752-774 AD in a historically recognised document called the 'Donation of Constantine.' Despite later revelations proving that the document was not penned by Constantine the Great, but rather by an anonymous author seeking to lend it authenticity, this so-called Donation of Constantine was accepted as valid by at least nine popes over the course of seven centuries or more. It was instrumental in establishing the spiritual and temporal supremacy of the bishops of Rome.

The title in question, a deliberate creation, was intended to denote the role of Peter as the inaugural Pope, in alignment with the claim held by the Roman Catholic Church that Jesus' words in Matthew 16: 18, 19, conferred upon Peter the inaugural bishopric of the church—a perspective not acknowledged by Protestant believers. This bishopric, they assert, was passed on to the successors occupying the papal throne, as articulated in the Donation of Constantine and sustained by the church to this day.
Binius, an eminent Roman Catholic dignitary of Cologne, posits that a church council affirmed the document containing the title. This claim is corroborated by Labbe and Cossart. Gratian incorporated the title into Roman Catholic canon law. When this work was revised and subsequently published, endorsed by Pope Gregory XIII, the title was preserved. Around 1755, Lucius Ferraris, in his comprehensive theological work, cited the title Vicarius Filii Dei under the entry 'Papa,' citing the revised canon law as his source. When Ferraris's work underwent expansion and revision, and was published in Rome in 1890, both the document and the title were retained.
The Catholic Encyclopedia lauds Ferraris's theological work as a source that 'will ever remain a precious mine of information.' The Donation of Constantine, confirmed by a church council, incorporated into Roman Catholic canon law, and referenced by Ferraris, is quoted herein in Latin.
The Canon law of Gratian, translated by Christopher Coleman, reads: 'As the blessed Peter is seen to have been constituted Vicar of the Son of God on the earth, so the pontiffs who are the representatives of that same chief of the apostles, should obtain from us and our empire the power of a supremacy greater than the clemency of our earthly imperial serenity.'
Edwin Lee Johnson, a professor of Latin and Greek at Vanderbilt University, offers a more liberal translation: 'Just as the Blessed Peter was appointed on earth vicar of the Son of God, so also it seems that the Pontiffs, his successors, hold on earth the power of the chief rule rather than (that) His Excellency, His Imperial Serene Highness on earth, (should hold it).'
As Revelation 13 concludes, it leaves the faithful staring down the hostile forces of the world, their lives and societal standing threatened for their unwavering adherence to God's commandments. In this designated time, Spiritism, performing its most awe-inspiring wonders, deceives all but the elect. This constitutes the 'hour of temptation,' or trial, the final test upon all inhabitants of the earth, as mentioned in Revelation 3:10. And what of the outcome of this conflict? This crucial question is not left unanswered. The opening verses of the subsequent chapter complete the prophecy's narrative, revealing the glorious victory of the stalwarts of truth.
